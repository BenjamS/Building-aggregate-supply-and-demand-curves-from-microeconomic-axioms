abstract: |
  Conventional models of the aggregate supply of agricultural commodities---specifically those used in ex-ante impact assessments of policy and research shocks---do not endogenously model the supply response to technology (or any other exogenous) shocks, but rather 1) assume the farm level supply response as exogenously given based on agronomic information, and then 2) assume, as a matter of fiat, the mechanism by which the farm level response manifests at the aggregate level (whether it is a shift or pivot of the aggregate supply curve, and what the adoption rate will be). Such models also do not account for farm heterogeneity---or, worse still, assume identical marginal farms---and do not account for farm entry/exit. For applications where these things matter, here a tractable aggregate supply model is formally derived from five weak axioms. Unlike the conventional models, the derived form is expressed in parameters that have clear economic meaning. This includes novel parameters such as price volatility and a term representing the mean probability of profit---which in turn endogenously accounts for farm entry/exit---thus broadening the range of policy questions that can be addressed in partial equilibrium analysis. As an illustrative use case, the model is fit to Kenya maize farm data. The fitted aggregate supply and price elasticity of aggregate supply curves agree with empirical estimates. Equations for the _endogenous_ adoption rate, supply response, and producer welfare impact are derived and showcased given a hypothetical exogenous technology shock in the Kenya maize farm population.

# Introduction

The conventional linear and constant elasticity of supply (CES) aggregate supply curves commonly used in ex-ante impact assessments of new agricultural technology [@alston1995science; @alston2009economics] are not explicitly derived from microeconomic axioms, but rather specified primarily to facilitate calculations of consumer and producer surplus, with little consideration given to the plausibility of the theoretical underpinnings and empirical implications of this choice of functional form. In particular, it is unclear whether these forms are consistent with standard microeconomic axioms regarding homogeneity, convexity/concavity, profit maximization, and the slope of farm level supply and input demand curves.
<!-- (The model documentation might make passing reference to such axioms; but the models themselves are not formally derived from them.) -->

That is to say, if we consider aggregate supply $Q$ in its most basic definition as the definite integral of farm production function $q^*$ times the production density $\rho(q^*)$ over the domain of profitable production $(\underline{q}^*, \overline{q}^*)$,

\begin{equation}
Q(P) = \int_{\underline{q}^*}^{\overline{q}^*} q^* \rho(q^*) \: dq^*
\label{eq:aggSup0}
\end{equation}

then it is not readily apparent from conventional linear and CES specifications of $Q$ what the function $q^*$ is, nor whether it is consistent with microeconomic theory. Critically, the conventional models also do not explicitly account for heterogeneously endowed farm populations (captured in the farm production density $\rho$)---or, worse still, assume a population of homogeneously endowed identical marginal farms; and they neglect to account for the domain of profitable production $(\underline{q}^*, \overline{q}^*)$, thus precluding any detailed analysis of supply response in terms of yield and entry/exit components.

Because these models are not formally derived from axioms, there is no clear mapping between their parameters and the relevant, measurable empirical phenomena (i.e., technology, input prices, agroclimatic conditions, demographic variables, etc.), such that it is not clear how a change in any of these phenomena might be accurately represented in terms of a change in parameter values, nor even which parameters might be affected by the change. This, in turn, precludes any endogenous modeling of economic decision making on the part of farmers in response to technology, or any other exogenous, shocks. Instead, the conventional models introduce farm level economic decision making (i.e., the economically rational supply/expenditure/input mix response to the exogenous shock) as a calibrated assumption based on agronomic data gathered from field trials, literature, and/or consultation with scientists involved in the research under evaluation.

This bears emphasis. The conventional aggregate supply models specifically designed for ex-ante impact assessment of new technology do not in fact model the supply response to new technology, but rather present a mathematical description of a presumed supply response that has been predetermined outside of the model, and then exogenously introduced into it. Model guidelines might offer some words of warning about the difference between economically and agronomically optimal yields/expenditures/input mixes, and about the glaring conflict of interest inherent in the expert opinion of scientists closely involved in the research under evaluation; but very little in the way of actionable advice is actually given. To redress conflicts of interest, e.g., Alston et al. [@alston1995science] prescribe the creation of
<!-- The absurdly high rates of return to agricultural R&D reported in the literature based on such models [@hurley2016] suggests that few practitioners follow this advice in any substantive way. -->

>\singlespacing"an environment of peer review and, perhaps, a competitive process (e.g., Delphi methods) that will reduce the potential for personal incentives to bias estimates of technical parameters, and...an institutional setting in which scientists will be held accountable for systematic biases in their estimates of research impact".

\doublespacing

Admirable aspirations, to be sure, but not actionable. If research institute directors are hard pressed to effect such deep cultural changes over the course of a multi-year tenure, how can the lowly economist tasked with the impact assessment---often hired by the scientists as a short term consultant---be expected to do so?

The subsequent step of translating the exogenously introduced farm level response into an aggregate supply response likewise involves no endogenous modeling of economic behavior, but rather exogenous guesswork translated into mathematical symbols. That is to say, after a long and inconclusive debate in the 1970s over whether the aggregate supply response should be represented as a pivot or parallel shift of the curve [@alston1995science; @norton1981evaluating; @voon1991calculation], or some combination thereof, the current default choice of parallel shift in most impact assessments emerges not on any theoretical or empirical basis, but purely as a matter of fiat [@alston2009economics].
<!-- The consensus since the 1990s is that the shock manifests as a parallel shift of the aggregate supply curve [@alston1995science]. But no theoretical or empirical grounds exist for this preference over, say, a supply curve pivot, or a combination of pivot and shift, which would result in a very different calculation of net benefits [@alston1995science; @alston2009economics]. -->

The final step of calculating net benefits in terms of discounted economic surplus, adjusted for probability of success, expected adoption rate, time lags in research and adoption, capital depreciation, and other exogenously collected parameters, bears many of the markings of a rigorous economic assessment. But insofar as the result of this calculation is prefigured by the initial, exogenously determined farm supply/expenditure response to technology change, and to its expression-by-fiat at the aggregate level, it is not so much an impact assessment as it is an impact _assertion_, i.e., an exercise in _petitio principii_.
<!-- To put it more plainly, impact assessments based on conventional supply curves are offer a depiction of what net benefits could look like _if_ the assumed supply and demand curves, type of supply curve shift, and magnitude of the shift are accurate (with no theoretical or empirical basis to suspect that they are). The  -->

Critics have long noted as much, if perhaps in a more understated way. Rose [-@rose1980supply], for example, notes that

>\singlespacing"[T]reatments have been concentrated on increasing the geometric sophistication of explanatory models and even that has been subject to fundamental errors. What is more important is to have an understanding of supply curves and the derivation of cost changes. Geometric manipulations are of little help at that level" [@rose1980supply].

\doublespacing

In other words, policy formation does not require mathematical descriptions of an exogenously assumed supply response to exogenous shocks, but rather endogenous modeling of the supply response to exogenous shocks. For those interested in such modeling, here an aggregate supply curve function is derived from the following five non-controversial economic axioms.

1) Diminishing marginal returns to input use

2) Farms maximize their expected net benefit subject to a budget constraint

3) Farms enter production only if they expect to make non-negative profit

4) Farm yield is lognormally distributed

5) Output price follows a geometric Brownian motion over time

In the course of the derivation, it becomes evident that five other desirable properties immediately follow from axioms 1 and 2 as corollaries, and need not be imposed as additional axioms: 1) The farm yield function is homogeneous (and thus homothetic) and 2) concave in inputs; 3) farm supply curves are upward sloping; 4) input demand curves are downward sloping; and 5) the derived yield function implies agreement with a consensus view of economic rationale driving technology adoption articulated by Lipton [-@lipton2005family].

On the other hand, two somewhat controversial corollaries also follow from this axiomatic approach: strictly decreasing returns to scale and constant marginal cost. The former contradicts the conventional wisdom handed down by Hicks [-@hicks1963theory] and Solow [-@solow1957technical]. The latter is well supported empirically [@lavoie2014post], but is eschewed in textbooks. Regardless of one's view on returns to scale and marginal cost curves, the very fact that it is possible to disagree with specific corollaries, and to trace the disagreement back to specific axioms, underscores a key strength of the derived model: its theoretical transparency. Under the theoretic opacity of the expedient approach, by contrast, it is not even possible to know if one agrees or disagrees with the premises, or whether the premises contradict each other mathematically, since those premises are stated in literary form (if they are stated at all), and the model is not explicitly derived from such premises.

All of the parameters appearing in the derived model have a straightforward interpretation in terms of relevant, measurable, empirical phenomena. This includes, in addition to the usual variables of interest (technology, agroclimatic variables, output price), a term that indirectly accounts for the farm employment rate (i.e. farm entry/exit) in response to price movements, and which is partly a function of farm expenditure population parameters. This facilitates the exploration of a range of distributional policy issues that conventional modeling approaches are admittedly ill suited to address [@norton1992economic]. When axiom 5 comes into play, the distributional term is shown to have a dual expression in stochastic price parameter space as the mean farm's probability of profit. Expression in stochastic price parameter space also introduces an alternative set of parameters (output price trend and volatility parameters, and the length of cropping season) that further extend the range of policy questions that can be addressed within the derived modeling framework.

<!-- the probability that output price will be greater than the mean farm's expected unit cost at harvest---i.e. the mean farm's probability of profit -->

In the Methodology section, immediately below, the model is derived from axioms 1-5. This includes a derivation of equations for assessing the endogenous supply response and producer welfare impact given an exogenous technology shock, together with an endogenous model of the adoption rate. The adoption rate model includes a term accounting for subsidies. The stochasticity of meteorology and output price is introduced at the end of the section. All major differences between the present work and the conventional model stem from this explicit, careful accounting of the endogenous response to exogenous shock, and of the stochastic nature of meteorology and output price.

After the Methodology, the derived model is fit to Kenya maize farm data as an illustrative use case. The fitted maize supply model is vetted against empirical estimates of maize supply at different price points across seven years. The model's estimates of both supply and the price elasticity of supply agree closely with empirical estimates. The model's explicit stochastic accounting of rainfall proves critical to this accuracy. A hypothetical, generic technology shock is then introduced in order to showcase the model's impact assessment capacity. The endogenously modeled aggregate supply response to the shock, and associated producer welfare outcomes, are evaluated at a range of different subsidy levels and assumed price shocks. Results are presented in a heatmap format to facilitate policy discussion and decision making.

Because the conventional linear and CES aggregate supply functions are in such wide use, an in depth literature review is included in the Appendix for those requiring a more detailed engagement with the literature than the cursory treatment above, and to thereby place the motivation for the present work on a more solid footing.

<!-- Changes in agronomic yield and expenditure observed at research stations do not directly translate into changes in economic yield and expenditure likely to occur in real farm populations. This economically obvious, empirically well documented [@herdt1988increasing; @balasubramanian2000yield], fact of life bears mentioning here because confusion about the difference between experimental agronomic and real world economic farm outcomes still pervades the conversation in many areas of agricultural research impact assessment [@sumberg2012mind]. And this is arguably rooted in the lack of practical, formal tools for addressing the matter in the conventional ex-ante impact assessment framework. To be clear, the authors of the conventional framework are cognizant of the matter; but offer little in the way of practical, formal tools for addressing it [@alston1995science]. -->

# Literature review

## Is impact assessment insensitive to misspecification of the supply curve?

When pressed on the matter, proponents of the conventional aggregate supply functions make little attempt to defend their specifications on empirical or theoretical grounds. On the contrary, proponents of linear models generally admit that real world commodity supply and demand curves are almost certainly never linear [@brester2023equilibrium]. Proponents of the CES model generally argue that CES models are probably at least slightly more accurate than linear specifications [@voon1991calculation], but likewise offer no formal derivation of their model from theory. Rather, the defense of conventional models centers on the argument that the functional form is irrelevant for purposes of impact assessment.
<!-- On the contrary, everyone involved in this literature acknowledges that the functional forms are specified primarily to facilitate calculations of consumer and producer surplus [@lindner1978supply; @alston1995science; @rose1980supply]. -->

>\singlespacing"The pertinent question is whether the functional form used is an adequate approximation for the purpose. It turns out, empirically, that measures of total research benefits and their distribution between producers and consumers are quite insensitive to choices of functional form. They are much more sensitive to the related but separate choices concerning the nature of the research-induced supply curve shift and elasticities" [@alston1995science].

\doublespacing

Alston et al. [-@alston1995science] cite three peer reviewed articles in support of this claim. One of the cited articles actually runs contrary to the claim, explicitly concluding that impact assessment results are highly sensitive to choices of functional form [@voon1991calculation]---a conclusion subsequently reaffirmed in a comment [@elbasha1997calculation] and reply [@edwards1997calculation]. Another cited article, by Lindner and Jarrett [-@lindner1978supply], concludes that impact assessment results are sensitive to the nature of the supply curve shift (pivot versus parallel shift); but also acknowledges that these shifts are determined by the choice of functional form. In their words,

>\singlespacing"[P]ast studies have made no attempt to justify or explain the particular assumptions made about the type of supply shift. In fact, in some studies the impression is given that the type of supply shift was determined by the specification of the mathematical form of the supply curve, which in turn appears to have been chosen simply for computational convenience" [@lindner1978supply].

\doublespacing

By the transitive property, then, their conclusion regarding impact assessment sensitivity to the type of supply curve shift extends to functional form, again contrary to the claim that functional form is irrelevant. Similarly, the third cited article, by Norton and Davis [-@norton1981evaluating], asserts that functional form is "less important than the type and magnitude of the supply shift". But then, contrary to this assertion, the authors proceed to survey four examples where the mathematical form of the shift is clearly prefigured by that of the supply curve; and explicitly state that differences between the four examples in the assessment of net benefits are due to differences in both type/magnitude of shift and functional form. Alston et al. [-@alston1995science] themselves point out that the practitioner is at liberty to choose between different types of shift only in the case of the linear specification---where the choice is between a pivot and a parallel shift, or some combination thereof. In the case of the CES specification, the practitioner is constricted to assume a pivot (a point later emphasized by Voon and Edwards [-@voon1991calculation]). And elsewhere Alston writes that "the choice [of type of supply shift is] dictated by analytic convenience, given _a prior_ choice of functional form for supply" [@martin1997producer].

A fourth document is also cited [@alston1990measuring], but is not peer reviewed and not, at the time of writing, readily available from the publisher. A subsequent peer reviewed article by Zhao et al. [-@zhao1997functional] cites the unavailable document as an annex to a technical report on R&D in the Australian wool industry. The main text of this report appears to have been published in a peer reviewed journal, but without the annex in question [@scobie1991returns]. In their own analysis, Zhao et al. [-@zhao1997functional] find that assessment of net benefits (economic surplus) is highly sensitive to misspecification of the functional form in the case of the CES specification, again contrary to the claim that impact assessments are insensitive to misspecification of the supply curve.

They also find that impact assessment is insensitive to misspecification error when 1) the linear specification is assumed together with 2) a parallel shift, and assuming 3) the shift is small [@zhao1997functional]. Proponents and critics alike acknowledge that the empirical and theoretical grounds for assumptions 1 and 2 are narrow, at best [@lindner1978supply; @alston2009economics; @voon1991calculation; @rose1980supply]. If the real shift is a pivot or mixture of pivot and shift, then Zhao et al.'s finding of insensitivity does not apply. Moreover, it is questionable whether the parallel supply curve shifts assumed in most economic surplus assessments of returns to agricultural R&D qualify as "small" [@hurley2014re; @alston2000research]. To know for sure, Zhao et al. [-@zhao1997functional] develop a method to calculate the upper bound on misspecification bias; but the present literature review finds no instance where this method has actually been implemented. Finally, Zhao et al. [-@zhao1997functional] acknowledge that their findings regarding linear misspecification are valid only insofar as farm populations consist entirely of identical marginal farms, a condition never actually observed in any real farm population.

In synthesis, then, it is misleading to characterize the cited literature as supportive of Alston et al.'s [-@alston1995science] broad claim that impact assessments are insensitive to misspecification of the functional form of the supply curve. More accurately, the literature supports the much narrower claim that impact assessments are insensitive to misspecification when the linear specification is assumed together with a parallel shift, and when the real shift is also parallel; and when the shift is small, and when the farm population consists of identical marginal farms. Apart from this exceptionally implausible case identified by Zhao et al. [-@zhao1997functional], the literature indicates that impact assessments are highly sensitive to functional form, whether directly, as in the case of the CES function, or by the transitive property, i.e., through a supply curve shift which is mathematically prefigured by the functional form of the supply curve.

## Is it impossible to do any better?

As a final line of defense, proponents of conventional aggregate supply curves argue that there is no alternative to their cavalier approach of arbitrarily assuming a functional form for supply curves and supply curve shifts, however implausible or grossly inaccurate they might be. Alston et al. [-@alston1995science] write:

>\singlespacing"What does economic theory tell us about the nature of ...[research induced aggregate supply curve] shifts? Unfortunately, not very much. To be confident about this aspect of the problem would require either (a) precise econometric evidence or (b) detailed information on the effects on individual agents, details of industry structure including details on exit and entry of firms, and a complete theory of aggregation. This information is not available; assumptions are unavoidable".

\doublespacing

<!-- The aggregate supply model derived in the subsequent sections -->
The present work is effectively one long disagreement with this passage. The sweeping claim that economic theory does not tell us "very much" about the nature of aggregate supply curve shifts is especially perplexing. On the contrary, economic theory provides a set of microeconomic principles whence a firm level yield envelope is derived, whence "effects on individual agents", i.e., farm level response to exogenous shock, can be can modeled. Insofar as the phrase "complete theory of aggregation" refers to the specification of aggregate supply and demand curves, this too can be derived from theory by integrating individual effects over a suitable density function (i.e., Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0}). The firm yield model implies bounds on the domain of optimal output, such that the "exit and entry of firms" is accounted for by integrating over the domain of optimal behavior.
<!-- (Similar bounds can be determined for optimal input use, whence an aggregate demand curve could be derived; but the focus here is limited to aggregate supply.) -->

To be clear, the "precise econometric evidence or...detailed information" that the authors refer to is, indeed, generally not available; but the suggestion that economic theory offers nothing in its stead is mistaken. One of the key purposes of having a theory is to draw inference when detailed information is unavailable or otherwise provides no clear answer to our questions. And, yes, "assumptions are unavoidable"---but in the sense that axioms 1-5 in the Introduction are unavoidable, not in the sense of superimposing an exogenously assumed supply response on top of said axioms. Not economic theory, then, but rather a descriptive mathematical formulation which, by construction, precludes endogenous modeling of the aggregate supply response to exogenous shocks, is what tells us "not very much" about the the aggregate supply response to exogenous shocks.
<!-- The authors themselves may have made little use of theory when they specified their linear aggregate supply and demand curves; but this does not mean that others are prohibited from doing so. -->

## The limited policy relevance of conventional forms

Effective policy formation requires careful assessment not only of the magnitude of net benefits of a given intervention, but also of their distribution across producers and consumers (the "food price dilemma"), and across income levels. Proponents and critics alike acknowledge that conventional functional forms are ill suited to the assessment of such distributional issues [@alston2009economics; @alston1995science; @lindner1978supply; @rose1980supply; @wohlgenant1997nature].

More specifically, impact assessments based on a pivot of the linear or CES supply curve can result in consumer-producer tradeoffs, whereas assessments based on a linear parallel shift of the linear supply curve guarantee increases in both consumer and producer welfare [@alston2009economics]. With no clear theoretical or empirical premise upon which to recommend one set of results over another, little confidence can be attached to any of them. This is remarkable considering that the primary motive for conventional supply curve specifications is to facilitate the assessment of changes in consumer and producer surplus. It is also noteworthy that, of all the possible arbitrary configurations of supply curve and type of shift, most agricultural R&D impact assessments assume the one that, by construction, results in the highest net benefits and avoids any food-price dilemma [@hurley2014re; @alston2000research; @alston2009economics].
<!-- mainly because they are not explicitly derived from a theoretical framework that maps model parameters to specific empirical economic phenomena. -->
<!-- Effective food policy formation requires careful assessment not only of the magnitude of net benefits of a given intervention, but also of resulting consumer-producer tradeoffs (the "food price dilemma"), as well as the distributional effects of the intervention across income levels. In recent decades, rural-urban migration, and hence rural employment (farm entry/exit), is also a major concern []; as well as the overarching issue of smallholder price risk and risk-mitigating mechanisms []. -->
<!-- Due to the fundamental disconnect between theory and functional form outlined above,  Impact assessment results regarding consumer-producer tradeoffs vary considerably with the assumed functional form and type of supply curve shift [@alston2009economic].  -->
<!-- conspicuous -->

As for the assessment of impacts on income inequality, conventional models are ill suited because, as noted earlier, they either do not explicitly account for heterogeneous farm endowments (in the case of the CES curve), or assume a population of identically endowed marginal farms (in the case of the linear specification). In some sectors, one might reasonably justify the assumption of homogeneously endowed firms by invoking competitive long run equilibrium. Such arguments are strained in the primary sector, however, where one typically sees an abundance of heterogeneously endowed, inframarginal farms in operation. By failing to account for such heterogeneity, the conventional models fail to account for farm entry/exit. (See Wohlgenant [-@wohlgenant1997nature] for a deeper treatment of this point.)

Proponents of the conventional approach even go so far as to expressly discourage the assessment of distributional equity vis-a-vis agricultural research, arguing that such issues lie beyond its scope.
<!-- Wohlgenant [-@wohlgenant1997nature] demonstrates that the long run equilibrium supply curve cannot be linear under such circumstances, even if the supply curves of individual farms are all linear. -->

>\singlespacing"For many economists...the only defensible justification for government intervention in agricultural research, and the only legitimate and achievable objective of research, is the pursuit of economic efficiency. This is not to say that other objectives (such as...income distribution and food security) are illegitimate, irrelevant, or unimportant but that there are likely to be alternative, less costly ways to achieve these other objectives than by biasing the agricultural research portfolio away from programs that will maximize total national net income" [@alston1995science].

\doublespacing

An underlying assumption here is that distributional equity and economic growth ("efficiency") are mutually exlusive objectives, such that the one cannot be pursued except at the cost of the other. Norton [-@norton1992economic] makes this explicit by actually drawing an equity-efficiency tradeoff frontier to illustrate the concept. Again citing "many economists", he affirms that "agricultural research is a relatively poor instrument for achieving non-efficiency objectives".

The authors provide no references to indicate who they mean by "many economists"; and it is not readily obvious who they might have in mind. On the contrary, many economists think and/or have demonstrated econometrically that the exact opposite is true: agricultural research generally results in agricultural productivity growth, which goes hand in hand with poverty reduction [@rosegrant2001transforming; @ravallion1996important; @thorbecke1996multiplier; @fan2005rural; @bourguignon1998inequality; @timmer1997well; @gallup1998economic; @ravallion1999gowth; @ravallion2002has; @byerlee2009agriculture; @valdes2010reflections; @kydd2004agricultural; @world2007world; @de2020using; @de2022agriculture; @gollin2021two]. Publicly funded agricultural research since the 1960s has generally endeavored to align with pro-poor growth objectives, with mixed success [@thirtle2003impact; @adato2007agricultural; @hazell2001agricultural; @lipton2005family; @redclift1983production; @feleke2016assessing; @pingali1998impact; @mathur2003agricultural]. Moreover, it is now well documented that a nation's economic growth is generally more robust and sustainable in the measure that it is equitable [@partridge1997inequality; @easterly2007inequality; @berg2012makes; @ostry2015inequality; @berg2017inequality; @berg2018redistribution; @ostry2021growth]. Equity and sustainable growth are not mutually exclusive, but rather "two sides of the same coin" [@berg2017inequality].

Finally, conventional models also introduce awkward artifacts that further undermine their explanatory power. The CES function, by definition, implies that yield and entry/exit responses to price changes always offset each other precisely such that the elasticity of supply is constant. The linear aggregate supply curve implies the possibility of negative supply quantities and/or of farms producing for free. This either requires redefinition of the curve as a piecewise function---which further complicates interpretation in terms of Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0}---or compels us to regard the function as a local approximation to some inscrutable global function, with validity restricted to a small domain of convergence around the starting equilibrium point.

## Real consequences

There is a growing "disconnect" between the actual level of funding for agricultural research and the level of funding that would be justified by impact assessments conducted on the basis of conventional aggregate supply models [@hurley2016returns]. And there is good reason to suspect that this disconnect is due to the implausibly high---and sometimes absurdly high---internal rates of return (IRR) reported in conventional impact assessments of agricultural R&D [@hurley2014re; @alston2001attribution; @hurley2016returns]. The high reported returns are, of course, made more conspicuous by the aforementioned conflict of interest inherent in the expert opinion upon which these studies are typically based. In a meta-analysis of 492 such impact assessments, for example, Hurley et al. [@hurley2016returns] note that the average reported IRR implies that the USDA's 2000 R&D investment of \$4.1 billion should be worth \$56.3 quintillion in 2050, or 2.3 million times projected world GDP at that time.^[The meta-analysis covered a variety of impact assessment methods in addition to expedient specifications of aggregate supply (economic surplus analyses). It is safe to assume that most of these studies were economic surplus analyses.] "[I]t is not difficult to see," the authors conclude, "how policy makers may question the credibility of such evidence" [@hurley2016returns].
<!-- It could merely reflect the low cost of implementing the model, for example, and/or the lack of comparably low cost alternatives.  -->
<!-- [In discussion: The implausibility is made more conspicuous considering that these assessments are typically written by or in close consultation with the scientists whose research is under evaluation, and who thus have a vested interest in its success.] -->

Hurley et al. [@hurley2014re] respond to the incredulity of policy makers by replacing IRR with their "modified" IRR or "MIRR", whereby implausibly high projected returns are deflated to plausible levels. This is a suitable response insofar as the implausibility in question is rooted in the discounting method (although see the debate between Ohemke [-@oehmke2017re] and Hurley et al. [-@hurley2017re]). However, the theoretical opacity, dubious implications, and limited interpretability of these models, outlined above, are good reason to suspect that much of the incredulity is in fact aimed at the impact modeling itself, particularly the modeling of aggregate supply and the supply response to exogenous shocks. Insofar as this is true, MIRR is an insufficient response, and may even exacerbate the problem by masking the real sources of inaccuracy.

# Methodology: Theoretically derived, endogenous modeling of aggregate supply and response to exogenous shock

Below, a deterministic model of aggregate supply and endogenous response to technology (or any other kind of exogenous) shock is derived from axioms 1-5. First, the farm production function is derived from axioms 1 and 2. Then a deterministic aggregate supply function is derived from the farm production function and axioms 3 and 4. (This is deterministic in the sense that it does not take into account the stochasticity of output price and weather.) An alternative deterministic form for aggregate supply is also derived based on the relation between conditional and unconditional means. Practical steps for evaluating curve parameters are briefly enumerated; and the importance of accounting for "stratified TFP"---i.e., variations in total factor productivity across farm populations---is addressed. The farm level endogenous yield and expenditure response to exogenous shock is then formalized---including a formula for calculating the endogenous adoption rate---and aggregated. Finally, stochasticity and axiom 5 are introduced to explicitly account for random fluctuations in weather and output price, resulting in the final functional form for expected aggregate supply.

## Derivation of the farm production function from axioms 1 and 2 \label{sec:axioms1and2}

Throughout much of written history, astute observers have noticed that the usefulness of increments in the quantity of a good is inversely proportional to amount of the input or good or service already acquired [@kauder1953genesis]. In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli put it this way:
<!-- an input (in the case of producer yield functions) or good or service (in the case of consumer utility functions) -->

>\singlespacing "In the absence of the unusual, the utility resulting from any small increase in wealth will be inversely proportionate to the quantity of goods previously possessed" [@bernoulli1954exposition].

\doublespacing
<!-- Today, this is known as the "law of diminishing marginal returns". -->
<!-- \begin{framed} -->
<!--    \textbf{Axiom 1} \\ The law of diminishing marginal returns. -->
<!-- \end{framed} -->
<!-- Formalization of Bernoulli's verbal statement of the law of diminishing marginal returns depends upon how one defines "small increase". If "small increase" means a marginal increase, then Bernoulli's statement can be written down as follows.^[Bernoulli himself could not have had "marginal increase" in mind per se, as calculus had not yet been invented.] -->

Today, this is known as the "law of diminishing marginal returns". Bernoulli's statement is a consumer side formulation of the law. It can also has a producer side formulation: "In the absence of the unusual, the yield increase resulting from any small increase in a given input will be inversely proportionate to the quantity of the input already applied." With the aid of calculus (which was not available to Bernoulli), this may be formalized as follows.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \ln(y)}{\partial x} \sim \frac{1}{x}
\label{eq:dimUtilDefine}
\end{equation}

Where, to be clear, the term $\partial \ln(y) / \partial x$ is the percentage change in yield given a marginal increase in the quantity of good $x$, and "$\sim 1 / x$", means "inversely proportionate to the quantity of good $x$ already acquired". An expression $y(x)$ for the yield of good $x$ can then be obtained by integrating Bernoulli's statement.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\int \frac{\partial \ln(y)}{\partial x} \: dx &= \int \alpha \frac{d \ln(x)}{dx} \: dx \\
\ln(y(x))  &= \alpha \ln(x) + k \\
y(x) &= e^k x^{\alpha}
\end{split}
\label{eq:integrate_lny}
\end{equation}

Where the proportionality constant $\alpha = \partial \ln(y)/ \partial \ln(x)$ is the input elasticity of yield, i.e., the percentage change in yield given a $1$ percent increase in input $x$.

In the multivariate case, an expression $y(\mathbf{x})$ for yield as a function of a vector of $n$ goods $\mathbf{x} = [x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$ can be obtained as follows.

\begin{equation}
\int \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \ln(y) \cdot d \mathbf{x} = \int D(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \ln(\mathbf{x}) \cdot d \mathbf{x}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\ln(y(\mathbf{x})) &= \boldsymbol{\alpha} \cdot \ln(\mathbf{x}) + \alpha_0 \\
y &= e^{\alpha_0} \prod_{i = 1}^{n} x_i^{\alpha_i}
\end{split}
\label{eq:cobbDoug}
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ is the vector of input elasticities corresponding to each $x_i$, the notation $D(\boldsymbol{\alpha})$ indicates a diagonal matrix with the elements of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ along its diagonal, and

\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \ln(y) = \left[ \begin{matrix} \frac{\partial \ln(y)}{\partial x_1} \\
\frac{\partial \ln(y)}{\partial x_2} \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial \ln(y)}{\partial x_n}
\end{matrix} \right]
\end{equation}

It is straightforward to see that equation \ref{eq:cobbDoug2} is a homogeneous (and thus also homothetic) function with degree of homogeneity $h$ equal to $\sum_i \alpha_i$. There is no need, then, to impose homogeneity as an additional axiom. It follows from the axiom of diminishing marginal returns.

Empirical analysis involves exogenously given control variables ($k_i$), typically including demographic variables such as age, education, gender, household size, as well as agroclimatic variables such as temperature, rainfall, soil conditions, and so forth. Equation \ref{eq:cobbDoug} is thus henceforth rewritten as follows.
<!-- (Analysis is said to be "ceteris paribus" when these variables are held constant at a particular value across the population.) -->

\begin{equation}
y = g \prod_{i = 1}^{n_k} k_i^{\kappa_i} \prod_{i = 1}^{n_x} x_i^{\alpha_i} \:\:;\:\:\: g = e^{\alpha_0}
\label{eq:cobbDoug2}
\end{equation}

Where the $\kappa_i$ are the control variable elasticities of yield. Because the control variables $k_i$ are non-discretionary, the corresponding elasticities $\kappa_i$ may take positive or negative values. The input elasticities $\alpha_i$, on the other hand, which correspond to discretionary management variables, are generally positive. For purposes of economic analysis, the degree of homogeneity is calculated only over the production elasticities corresponding to management variables ($h = \sum_i \alpha_i$, omitting the $\kappa_i$).
<!-- However, there may arise cases where a variable does not fall neatly into either the management or control category. In the empirical analysis presented farther below, for example, the coefficient on child family labor takes a negative value. Labor is generally considered a discretionary management variable; but family labor, and especially child family labor, might, in some cases, better be considered a control variable, indicative of hard constraints beyond the farmers' discretion. -->
<!-- Axiom 1 gives us the farm yield function as a multivariate power law (see Appendix for details of the derivation.) -->
<!-- Where the $x_i$ are management inputs (fertilizer, etc.), the $k_i$ are control variables (demographic and agroclimatic variables, etc.), and the $\alpha_i$ and $\kappa_i$ are input and control variable elasticities of yield, respectively. The input elasticities of yield are also referred to collectively as the "technology". The product bounds $n_x$ and $n_k$ indicate the number of inputs and control variables, respectively. -->
<!-- The variables $x_i$ and $k_i$ are assumed to be linearly independent and are divided by their population means ($\tilde{x}_i$, $\tilde{k}_i)$, such that $y_0$ may be interpreted as the mean yield.  -->

This is, of course, the Cobb-Douglas form. Outside of Economics, it would simply be referred to as a (multivariate) power law. Such forms are often good models of observed processes across a wide range of research contexts and disciplines. In Economics, the Cobb-Douglas form was widely used from the 1920s to 1950s on the basis of its good empirical fit, but fell into disrepute thereafter for its perceived lack a theoretical basis. Capalbo and Antle [-@capalbo2015agricultural] offer a succinct introduction to this vast discussion. The forgoing derivation of the Cobb-Douglas form from axiom 1 in some measure redresses the lack of a theoretical basis. A full defense against all of the criticisms levied against this form over the past seventy five years is a book-length project that will not be attempted here.
<!-- [Other perceived shortcomings of the form are briefly addressed in the Discussion. if there is enough space!] [Or: In the course of the derivation below, a number of theoretical strengths are brought to light---underrepresented or overlooked by textbook treatments---that cast doubt on the bad reputation as a "restrictive" model] -->

Interpretation of the constant $g$ is as difficult as one wants to make it. It is, of course, usually called the "total factor productivity" (TFP), and understood to represent the yield per unit "all inputs"---although a more accurate description would be yield per unit "all input and control variables, raised to various powers". The TFP constant $g$ may in fact be a sum of binary endowments $b_i \beta_i$ that augment the base constant $\beta_0$ on farms where the endowment is present (where $b_i = 1$). That is to say, 

\begin{equation}
\ln(g) = \alpha_0 = \beta_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n_b} b_i \beta_i
\label{eq:g0Sum}
\end{equation}

In the Kenya maize farm exercise farther below, for example, there are four ($n_b = 4$) binary endowment variables $b_i$ (which take a value of $1$ if the endowment is present and $0$ otherwise): use of oxen in land preparation, use of tractor in land preparation, use of hybrid maize seed, and land tenure. This means that $g$ can vary across the population. In the Kenya maize exercise, there are 12 unique values of $g$ in the population, corresponding to 12 unique combinations of the four binary endowments plus the base endowment constant $\beta_0$.

The parameter $g$ may also be arbitrarily defined in terms of a new parameter ($u$) combined with judiciously chosen reference terms such that the new parameter has a meaningful interpretation and/or results in a more useful expression for yield. For present purposes, $g$ is defined as follows
<!-- For those not yet comfortable working in units of, say, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \text{kg.} \times \: \text{acres}^{-1} \times \: \text{liters}^{-\alpha_{pest}} \times \: \text{kg.}^{-\alpha_{fert}} \times \: \text{manhours}^{-\alpha_{labor}} \times\: \\ \text{mm.}^{-\alpha_{rain}} \times\: \text{num. persons}^{-\alpha_{HHsize}} -->
<!-- $$ -->
 <!-- \:;\:\: \alpha_{(var)} \in \mathbb{R} -->
<!-- \: \text{years}^{-\alpha_{age}} \times\: -->
<!-- in terms of another constant $u$, the means $E[x_i]$, and the mean of    fixed reference values $\tilde{k}_i$, $\tilde{x}_i$ that have the same units as the corresponding management and control variables $x_i$ and $k_i$. -->
<!-- Because the ratios in parentheses are dimensionless, $y_0$ must have the same units as $y$; and $y_0$ may be interpreted as the value of $y$ when all management and control variables equal their reference values. In the empirical study included here, for example, the reference values are set equal to the sample means, such that $y_0$ is the value of $y$ evaluated at the sample means of the input and control variables. -->

\begin{equation}
g = \frac{u}{E[\prod_{i = 1}^{n_k} k_i^{\kappa_i}] \prod_{i = 1}^{n_x} E[x_i]^{\alpha_i}}
\label{eq:u0_for_g0}
\end{equation}

Where $u$ is a constant, such that $y$ may be rewritten

\begin{equation}
y = u \frac{k}{E[k]} \prod_{i = 1}^{n_x} \left( \frac{x_i}{E[x_i]} \right)^{\alpha_i} \:\:;\:\:\: k = \prod_{i = 1}^{n_k} k_i^{\kappa_i}
\label{eq:cobbDoug3}
\end{equation}

This substitution will soon be seen to facilitate interpretation and manipulation of the optimal yield function. But first the optimal yield function must be derived from axiom 2 (profit maximization). Defining farm net benefit or profit ($\mathcal{L}$) as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = Py - \lambda (C - B)
\label{eq:lagrangian}
\end{equation}

Where $P$ is the output price, $C$ is expenditure ($C = \mathbf{w}'\mathbf{x}$), $B$ is the farm budget and $\lambda$ is the farm budget shadow price---that is, the marginal benefit to the farm of a marginal increase in budget ($\partial \mathcal{L} / \partial B = \lambda$)---then the first order conditions for a maximum,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \mathcal{L} &= P \nabla_{\mathbf{x}} y - \lambda \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0} \\
&= Py D(\mathbf{x})^{-1} \boldsymbol{\alpha} - \lambda \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0} \\
& \text{(Where}\: \mathbf{0} \: \text{is a vector of zeroes equal to the length of}\: \mathbf{x} \text{.)}
\end{split}
\label{eq:eqFOC}
\end{equation}
<!-- (see Appendix A1 for details). SOC -->

can be rearranged into an expression for the $i^{th}$ input demand.

\begin{equation}
x^*_i = \frac{y^* P \alpha_i}{\lambda w_i}
\label{eq:inputDem1}
\end{equation}

Where $w_i \in\mathbf{w}$ is the $i^{th}$ input price, $\lambda$ is the farm budget shadow price, and $y*$ is the optimal yield, i.e., the yield function in Equation \ref{eq:cobbDoug2} evaluated at the optimal inputs $x^*_i$. Multiplying this expression for $x^*_i$ by $w_i$ and summing both sides over $i$ then gives an expression for optimal expenditure ($C^*$).

\begin{equation}
C^* = R^* \frac{h}{\lambda} \:;\:\:\: R^* = y^* P
\label{eq:cStar}
\end{equation}

Such that the input demand may be rewritten

\begin{equation}
x^*_i = \frac{C^* \alpha_i}{h w_i}
\label{eq:inputDem2}
\end{equation}

Taking the expectation and rearranging,

\begin{equation}
\frac{E[x^*_i]}{E[C^*]} = \frac{\alpha_i}{h w_i}
\end{equation}

Combining this with the previous equation gives

\begin{equation}
\frac{x^*_i}{E[x^*_i]} = \frac{C^*}{E[C^*]}
\end{equation}

Such that the optimal farm yield $y^*$ (Equation \ref{eq:cobbDoug3} evaluated at $x^*_i$) may be expressed

\begin{equation}
y^* = u \frac{k}{E[k]} \left( \frac{C^*}{E[C^*]} \right)^h
\label{eq:YdEnvNeat0}
\end{equation}

The expression can be simplified still further by taking the expectation and solving for $u$.

\begin{equation}
u = E[y^*] \frac{E[C^*]^h}{E[C^{*h}]}
\label{eq:muYstarU0}
\end{equation}

And then substituting this for $u$ in the yield expression.

\begin{equation}
y^* = E[y^*] \frac{k}{E[k]} \frac{C^{*h}}{E[C^{*h}]}
\label{eq:YdEnvNeat}
\end{equation}

This expression for optimal farm yield---henceforth referred to simply as the farm yield---is particularly useful as an econometric yield model, as it only requires information on the control variables $k_i$ and total cost $C^*$, and no information on individual input quantities, as would be required when estimating Equations \ref{eq:cobbDoug2} or \ref{eq:cobbDoug3}. Given farm data, one specifies the model

\begin{equation}
y^* = v k C^{*h}e^{\epsilon} \:\:;\:\:\: v = \frac{E[y^*]}{E[k] E[C^{*h}]}
\label{eq:YdEnvReg1}
\end{equation}

(Where $\epsilon$ is the error term.) Such that the estimated coefficient on logged farm cost may be directly interpreted as the degree of homogeneity for the population. When estimating the model in Equations \ref{eq:cobbDoug2} or \ref{eq:cobbDoug3}, by contrast, $h$ must be tallied by summing the estimated coefficients $\alpha_i$, and will likely vary across the population since not all farms necessarily apply all the inputs specified in the model. The new term $v$, moreover, retains meaning as a measure of TFP---and arguably a more instructive one since all inputs are expressed in identical units of cost. It is henceforth referred to as the "expenditure TFP", and is related to conventional TFP as follows.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
v &= \frac{u}{E[k] E[C^*]^h} \\
&= g \frac{\prod_i^{n_x}E[x_i]^{\alpha_i}}{E[C^*]^h} \\
&= g \frac{1}{h}\prod_i^{n_x} \left( \frac{\alpha_i}{w_i} \right)^{\alpha_i}
\end{split}
\label{eq:v0forms}
\end{equation}

Where the last line follows from the input demand expression in Equation \ref{eq:inputDem2}.

### Returns to scale, cancavity, price elasticities of farm supply and input demand

The second order condition for maximum profit is

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{x} ' \nabla_{\mathbf{x}}^2 \mathcal{L} \mathbf{x} &= P \mathbf{x} ' \nabla_{\mathbf{x}}^2 y \mathbf{x} ' < 0 \\
&= P h (h - 1) < 0
\end{split}
\label{eq:eqSOC}
\end{equation}

Where Euler's Theorem has been invoked in the second line of the condition. Axioms 1 and 2 thus require that yield exhibit decreasing returns to scale ($0 < h < 1$), whereby it also follows that yield is globally concave in inputs. (Increasing returns to scale would imply minimum profit and convexity in inputs, while constant returns would imply the break even point and linearity in inputs.)

The price elasticity of farm supply resolves as follows.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial P} = h \frac{\partial \ln(C^*)}{\partial P}
\end{equation}

Recalling that $C^* = R^* h / \lambda$ (Equation \ref{eq:cStar}), the output price elasticity of farm supply resolves as follows.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial P} &= h \frac{\partial \ln(C^*)}{\partial P} \\
&= h \left( \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial P} + \frac{1}{P} \right) \\
\frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial P} &= \frac{h}{1 - h} \frac{1}{P} \\
\frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(P)} &= \frac{h}{1 - h} \\
& \equiv \eta
\end{split}
\label{eq:PelastYstar}
\end{equation}

(Where Equation \ref{eq:cStar} is invoked in the second line.) Because returns to scale are strictly decreasing, it follows that farm supply is positively sloped. Moreover, farm supply is elastic for $h \in (1 / 2 , 1)$, inelastic for $h \in (0, 1 / 2)$, and linear when $h = 1 / 2$. Note that increasing returns to scale would imply negatively sloped supply curves. In Appendix A.1, the input own and cross price elasticities of demand are likewise derived and shown to be strictly negative only when returns to scale are decreasing.
<!-- Then $y^*$ can also be written -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- y^* = \left( g \prod_{i = 1}^{n_x} \left( \frac{\alpha_i}{w_i} \right)^{\alpha_i} \right) \left( \frac{P}{\lambda} \right) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- Whereby the price elasticity of farm yield follows as -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(P)} = \frac{h}{1 - h} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- In Appendices A.2 and A.3 it is shown that the second order conditions for maximum profit imply the degree of homogeneity $h$ must exhibit strictly decreasing returns to scale ($0 < h < 1$), whereby it also follows that farm , and that the farm supply curve is positively sloped. -->

## Aggregation of farm level supply based on axioms 3 and 4

The derivation of a compact, instructive expression for $y^*$ (Equation \ref{eq:YdEnvReg1}) brings us a step closer to parsing the aggregate supply function defined in Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0}. Denoting area $k_a$ such that $q^* = k_a y^*$,
<!-- Substituting Equation \ref{eq:qStar} for $q^*$ in Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0} gives -->

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Q &= N \int_{\underline{q}^*}^{\bar{q}^*} \rho(q^*) dq^* \\
&= N \int_{0}^{\infty} k_a \int_{0}^{\bar{y}^*} \rho(y^*) dy^* \rho(k_a) dk_a \\
&= N E[k_a] v \int_{0}^{\infty} k \int_{0}^{\bar{C}^*} C^{* h} \rho(C^*)  d C^* \rho(k) dk \\
&= N E[k_a] v  E[k] \int_{0}^{\bar{C}^*} C^{* h} \rho(C^*) d C^* \\
&= N E[k_a] \frac{E[y^*]}{E[C^{*h}]} \int_{0}^{\bar{C}^*} C^{* h} \rho(C^*) d C^*
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The integral is now over the domain of expenditure $C^* \in (0, \bar{C}^*)$ instead of the domain of production. Moreover, letting $C^{\#}$ denote optimal unit expenditure (also commonly referred to as the "average cost", $C^{\#} = C^* / y^*$), note that $C^*$ and $y^*$ can be rewritten in terms of $C^{\#}$ as follows.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
C^* = C^{\#} y^* &= C^{\#} v k C^{* h} \\
&rightarrow C^* = (v k C^{\#})^{\eta / h} \:\:;\:\:\: \eta = \frac{h}{1 - h} \\
&rightarrow y^* = (v k)^{\eta / h} C^{\# \eta}
\end{split}
\label{eq:fnCsharp}
\end{equation}

And note that taking the expected value of the last line and rearranging gives

\begin{equation}
v^{\eta / h} = \frac{E[y^*]}{E[k^{\eta / h}] E[C^{\# \eta}]}
\end{equation}

Such that aggregate supply can also be written in terms of an integral over $C^{\#} \in (0, \bar{C}^{\#})$,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
Q &= N E[k_a] v^{\eta / h} E[k^{\eta / h}] \int_{0}^{\bar{C}^{\#}} C^{\# \eta} \rho(C^{\#}) d C^{\#} \\
&= N E[k_a] \frac{E[y^*]}{E[C^{\# \eta}]} \int_{0}^{\bar{C}^{\#}} C^{\# \eta} \rho(C^{\#}) d C^{\#}
\end{split}
\label{eq:aggSupStep1}
\end{equation}

To parse further, the upper bound on unit expenditure $\bar{C}^{\#}$ and density function $\rho(C^{\#})$ are resolved from axioms 3 and 4 below. The farm employment rate is also resolved as a by product.

### Upper bound on expenditure, farm employment rate, deterministic aggregate supply \label{sec:addSupDet}
<!-- \label{sec:aggSup1} -->

Given the introduction of $C^{\#}$, note that Equation \ref{eq:cStar} simplifies to

\begin{equation}
C^{\#} = \frac{P}{\lambda} h
\label{eq:cSharp}
\end{equation}

Axiom 3 states that farms enter production only if they expect to make non-negative profit, i.e. if $C^* \leq R^*$, which simplifies to $C^{\#} \leq P$. (It follows from Equation \ref{eq:cStar} or \ref{eq:cStar} that another way of expressing axiom 3 is $\lambda \geq h$.) Note, in passing, that the farm employment rate $\mathcal{E}$ may thus be expressed as follows.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E} = \int_0^{P} \rho(C^{\#}) dC^{\#}
\end{equation}

Assuming yield is lognormally distributed (axiom 4), then so must be $C^*$ and $C^{\#}$; and this expression reduces to

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{E} &= \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(P) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} \right) \\
& m_{\#} = E[\ln(C^{\#})] \:\:\:\: s^2_{\#} = Var[\ln(C^{\#})]
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $\Phi()$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.

Now, to resolve the integral in the expression for aggregate supply (Equation \ref{eq:aggSupStep1}), note that, for any lognormally distributed variable $\chi$ and upper bound $\xi$,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\int_{0}^{\xi} \chi \rho(\chi) d\chi &= E[\chi] \Phi\left( \frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}} - s_{\chi} \right) \:\:; \\ 
&m_{\chi} = E[\ln(\chi)] \:\:\: s^2_{\chi} = Var[\ln(\chi)]
\end{split}
\label{eq:keyResult}
\end{equation}

(See Appendix A.4 for a proof.)

Substituting $\chi = C^{\# \eta}$ and $\xi = P$,

\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{P} C^{\# \eta} \rho(C^{\#}) d C^{\#} = E[C^{\# \eta}] \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(P) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} - \eta s_{\#} \right)
<!-- \label{eq:integralStep2} -->
\end{equation}

Substituting the right hand side of this expression for the integral in Equation \ref{eq:aggSupStep2}, the expression for aggregate supply simplifies as follows.

\begin{equation}
Q = N E[k_a] E[y^*] \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(P) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} - \eta s_{\#} \right)
\end{equation}

To reduce notational clutter, the shorthand $\mathcal{P}$ is henceforth introduced,

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}(\xi; m_{\chi}, s_{\chi}) = \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}} - s_{\chi} \right)
\end{equation}

Such that aggregate supply can be written more compactly as follows.

\begin{equation}
Q = N E[k_a] E[y^*] \mathcal{P}(P^{\eta}; m_{\#}, s_{\#})
\label{eq:aggSup1}
\end{equation}

Axioms 1-4 thus give us a provisional tractable expression for aggregate supply in terms of interpretable parameters. The derived form is provisional because it is a deterministic expression that does not capture the stochastic nature of meteorology and price movements affecting agricultural output. The stochastic dimension of aggregate supply is introduced along with axiom 5 farther below.

### Conditional vs. unconditional means, an alternative form for aggregate supply \label{sec:condMean}

It is important to keep in mind that $E[C^*]$, $E[y^*]$ are _unconditional_ means. Because axiom 3 truncates the upper tail of the distribution of $C^{\#}$ at $P$, then sample parameters calculated from observed data must be interpreted as _conditional_. That is to say, the sample means of expenditure and yield do not represent $E[C^*]$ and $E[y^*]$, but rather the conditional means $E[C^* | C^{\#} \leq P]$ and $E[y^* | C^{\#} \leq P]$. The conditional and unconditional means of any lognormally distributed variable $\chi$ with upper bound $\xi$ are related as follows.

\begin{equation}
E[\chi | \chi \leq \xi] \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}} \right) = E[\chi] \Phi \left(\frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}} - s_{\chi}\right)
\label{eq:keyResult2}
\end{equation}
<!-- Evaluating this relation at $\chi = C^{\# \eta}$ and $\xi = P$ gives -->

Whereby it follows that

\begin{equation}
E[C^{\# \eta}] \mathcal{P}(P, m_{\#}, s_{\#}) = E[C^{\# \eta} | C^{\#} \leq P] \mathcal{E}
\label{eq:condMeanCshrp}
\end{equation}

And

\begin{equation}
E[y^*] \mathcal{P}(P^{\eta}, m_{\#}, s_{\#}) = E[y^* | C^{\#} \leq P] \mathcal{E}
\label{eq:condMeanYd1}
\end{equation}

Such that aggregate supply may also be written

\begin{equation}
Q = N E[k_a] E[y^*|C^{\#} \leq P] \mathcal{E}
\end{equation}

Which may be useful for point estimates of aggregate supply along the curve since $E[y^*|C^{\#} \leq P]$ can be estimated from the observed yield distribution. This form is also instructive because $\mathcal{E}$ has a straightforward interpretation as the farm employment rate. However, it is inconvenient for purposes of drawing the entire aggregate supply curve, as the observed $E[y^*|C^{\#} \leq P]$ is valid only for the $P$ at which it is measured. The unconditional mean yield $E[y^*]$, on the other hand, is constant for all $P$. For this reason, Equation \ref{eq:aggSup1} is preferred for supply curve assessment. Moreover, the term $\mathcal{P}(P; m_{\#}, s_{\#})$ turns out to have a meaningful economic interpretation that will become clear when the stochastic character of price is taken into account farther below.

### Evaluating supply curve parameters in practice \label{sec:evalInPract}

Tractable expressions for mean expenditure and yield follow from Equations \ref{eq:fnCsharp} and from the lognormality of $y^*$ and $C^*$ (axiom 4).

\begin{equation}
E[C^*] = e^{m_c + frac{s^2_c}{2}}
\end{equation}

Where

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
m_c &= \frac{1}{1 - h}(\ln(v) + m_k + m_{\#}) \:\:;\:\:\: m_k = E[\ln(k)] \\
s_c^2 &= \frac{1}{(1 - h)^2} (s_k^2 + s_{\#}^2) \:\:;\:\:\: s_k^2 = Var[\ln(k)]
\end{split}
\label{eq:mCsC}
\end{equation}

And

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[y^*] &= v E[k] E[C^{* h}] \\
&= v E[k] e^{h m_c + h^2 \frac{s_c^2}{2}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The conditional means can be expressed by replacing $m_c$, $s_c$, $m_{\#}$, and $s_{\#}$ with the sample parameters $\bar{m}_c$, $\bar{s}_c$, $\bar{m}_{\#}$, and $\bar{s}_{\#}$, defined

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bar{m}_c &= E[\ln(C^*) | C^{\#} \leq P] \\
\bar{s}^2_c &= Var[\ln(C^*) | C^{\#} \leq P] \\
\bar{m}_{\#} &= E[\ln(C^{\#}) | C^{\#} \leq P] \\
\bar{s}^2_{\#} &= Var[\ln(C^{\#}) | C^{\#} \leq P]
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In practice, the sample parameters $\bar{m}_{\#}$ and $\bar{s}_{\#}$ can be calculated from the sample parameters $\bar{m}_c$ and $\bar{s}_c$ by rearranging Equations \ref{eq:mCsC} into expressions for $\bar{m}_{\#}$ and $\bar{s}_{\#}$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bar{m}_{\#} &= (1 - h) \bar{m}_c - \ln(v) - m_k \\
\bar{s}_{\#}^2 &= (1 - h)^2 \bar{s}_c^2 - s_k^2
\end{split}
\label{eq:mCshrpsCshrp}
\end{equation}

This is preferred to calculating the mean and standard deviation directly from observed $y^*/C^*$ because observed yield is harvest yield, whereas the $y^*$ appearing in all of the equations above refers not to harvest yield but to expected harvest yield at planting time. This becomes clear when stochasticity is taken into account.

Because $C^{\#}$ is lognormally distributed, the unconditional parameters $m_{\#}$ and $s_{\#}$ can then be deduced from the conditional parameters $\bar{m}_{\#}$ and $\bar{s}_{\#}$ by solving the following system of equations.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bar{m}_{\#} &= m_{\#} - s_{\#} \frac{\phi(z)}{\Phi(z)} \\
\bar{s}_{\#}^2 &= s_{\#}^2 \left( 1 - z \frac{\phi(z)}{\Phi(z)} - \left( \frac{\phi(z)}{\Phi(z)} \right)^2   \right) \:\:;\:\:\: z = \frac{\ln(P) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}}
\end{split}
\label{eq:cSharpUncondParams}
\end{equation}

Whence it is then possible to evaluate the unconditional parameters $m_c$, $s_c$, $E[C^*]$, and $E[y^*]$.

### TFP strata \label{sec:TFPstrata}

As noted earlier (Equation \ref{eq:g0Sum}), binary endowments $\beta_i b_i$, and hence TFP, vary across the population. In the Kenya maize farm example explored farther below, there are 12 distinct values of expenditure TFP, corresponding to 12 distinct combinations of the binary endowments, henceforth referred to as "TFP strata". Wherever $g$ or $v$ appears above, then, what is really meant is $g_{\ell}$ and $v_{\ell}$, where $\ell$ indexes the values of TFP corresponding to each stratum ($\ell \in (1,12)$ in this case). It follows that any parameters that are a function of $v_{\ell}$ likewise correspond to the $\ell^{th}$ stratum. In other words, $E[C^*]$ and $E[y^*]$ can be disaggregated by stratum as follows.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[C^*]_{\ell} &= e^{m_{c \ell} + frac{s^2_c}{2}} \\
\text{Where} &\:\:\: m_{c \ell} = \frac{1}{1 - h}(\ln(v_{\ell}) + m_k + m_{\#})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

And

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[y^*]_{\ell} &= v_{\ell} E[k] E[C^{* h}]_{\ell} \\
&= v_{\ell} E[k] e^{h m_{c \ell} + h^2 \frac{s_c^2}{2}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

To evaluate the stratified conditional (observed) means, replace $m_{c \ell}$, $s_c$ in these expressions with $\bar{m}_{c \ell}$, $\bar{s}_c$.

Parameters unindexed by $\ell$ refer to their average across all strata. For example, $E[y^*]$ refers to the unconditional mean yield evaluated at $v$, the average expenditure across all strata.

\begin{equation}
v = \sum_{\ell} \frac{N_\ell}{N} v_{\ell}
\end{equation}

Where $N_{\ell} / N$ is the fraction of farms in the $\ell^{th}$ TFP stratum.

## An endogenous model of supply response to and welfare impact of exogenous shock

Agronomic yield and expenditure response to exogenous stimulus at an experimental station does not translate into the economic yield and expenditure response likely to occur in real farm populations. This economically obvious fact of life [@herdt1988increasing; @balasubramanian2000yield] bears reiteration because confusion on this matter unfortunately still pervades the conversation in key areas of agricultural research impact assessment [@sumberg2012mind].

As noted in the Introduction, the authors of the conventional modeling framework are cognizant of the difference between economic yields and agronomic yields; and offer some words of warning on the matter [@alston1995science]. But they provide no practical, formal method to distinguish between the two or to explicitly relate the former to the latter, such that their model effectively blurs the technology shock and supply response together as a single, nebulous exogenous shock.

In this subsection, equations for the evaluation of the farm level endogenous supply and expenditure response to exogenous shock are derived and aggregated based on the model derived from axioms 1-4 in the subsections above. This includes endogenous assessment of the adoption rate. As mentioned earlier, all of the salient differences between the theoretical framework proposed here and the conventional approach stem from these two steps.

More specifically, whereas the conventional approach assumes the farm level expenditure and/or yield response to exogenous shock based on agronomic data and expert opinion, the approach explained below endogenously models the farm level response to the shock based on the theoretical model derived from axioms 1-4 above. The farm level response model explicitly accounts not only for the shock itself, but also for any anticipated changes in input and output price, and for any subsidies included in the technology package.

And whereas the conventional approach exogenously assumes the adoption rate, again typically based on the opinion of experts closely involved in the technology under evaluation, here the adoption rate follows endogenously from the theoretical derivation, based on whether or not adoption increases farm net benefit ($\mathcal{L}^*$).

### The endogenous farm yield and expenditure response to exgenous shock \label{sec:farmResp}

The impact of yield scaling technologies and/or management practices on farm supply and expenditure can be represented through perturbations of the TFP parameter ($g_{\ell}$). This is tantamount to adding a binary endowment variable to the TFP sum in Equation \ref{eq:g0Sum}. The four binary endowments included in the Kenya maize model example may be considered yield scaling interventions that increase the value of $g_{\ell}$ on farms where the endowment is present. The percentage increase in TFP given the introduction of a new intervention $\beta_5 b_5$ on adopting farms (farms where $b_5 = 1$) may be calculated as

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\partial \ln(g_{\ell}) &\approx \frac{g_{\ell}' - g_{\ell}}{g_{\ell}} \:\:; \:\:\: g_{\ell}' = g_{\ell} e^{\beta_5 b_5} \\
&\approx e^{\beta_5} - 1
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that the percentage increase is the same across all adopting farms regardless of the starting value $g_{\ell}$.

Ideally, the value of $\beta_5$ should be estimated directly from field trials. If this is not possible, then the estimate can be made on the basis of agronomic crop modeling and expert opinion. Regardless of the path taken in this exercise, it is critically important to keep in mind that the objective is to estimate the change in TFP ($\beta_5$ or $\partial \ln(g)$), not the change in economic yield itself ($\partial \ln(y^*)$). If information is gathered in terms of the change in agronomic yield and/or expenditure, then it must be converted into an estimate for $\partial \ln(g)$. The percentage changes in economic yield, expenditure, and expenditure TFP ($v$) then follow from Equations \ref{eq:fnCsharp} as a function of the change in TFP as well as any change in output and input prices.
<!-- The percentage changes in expenditure TFP ($v$), farm expenditure, and yield given a 1% change in $g$ follow from Equations \ref{eq:cStar} and \ref{eq:YdEnvReg1}. -->

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} &= \frac{1}{1 - h} \left( 1 - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \ln(g)} + h \frac{\partial \ln(P)}{\partial \ln(g)} \right) \\
\frac{\partial \ln(C^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} &= \frac{1}{1 - h} \left( 1 - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \ln(g)} + \frac{\partial \ln(P)}{\partial \ln(g)} \right) \\
\frac{\partial \ln(v)}{\partial \ln(g)} &= 1 - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \ln(g)}
\end{split}
\label{eq:dldlg0}
\end{equation}

(See Appendix A.2 for details.)

The direction of the expected change in prices depends upon the type of research product. Most agricultural research currently falls into one of two broad paradigms: "sustainable agricultural intensification" (SAI) or "agroecological intensification" (AEI) [@mockshell2018beyond]. Widespread adoption of a new SAI technology typically results in increased output supply and input demand, and hence a lower output price and higher input prices. Widespread adoption of an AEI technology, on the other hand, typically results in lower input demand and emphasizes yield stability over quantity, hence lowering input prices and having little or uncertain impact on output price. For illustrative purposes, in this article the new technology is assumed to be an SAI research product, such that $\partial \ln(\mathbf{w}) / \partial \ln(g) > 0$ and $\partial \ln(P) / \partial \ln(g) < 0$).

### The endogenous adoption rate \label{sec:adopt}
<!-- Aggregate outcomes of an exogenous intervention depend critically on the adoption rate. This, in turn depends upon the profitability of adoption at the farm level. -->
<!-- Given the forgoing, the objective function evaluated at optimal yield ... -->
<!-- From the objective function -->

The farm net benefit function in Equation \ref{eq:lagrangian} evaluated at $y^*$ gives the farm net benefit envelope.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{L}^* &= \mathcal{L}|_{y = y^*} = R^* + \lambda (B - C^*) \\
&= \frac{\lambda}{h} ((1 - h) C^* + h B)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
<!-- By Equation \ref{eq:cStar}, this reduces to -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \mathcal{L}^* = R^* (1 - h) + \lambda B -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

The welfare effect on a given farm of adopting the new technology can be examined by differentiating $\mathcal{L}^*$ with respect to the change in TFP.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}^*}{\partial \ln(g)} &= \frac{\lambda}{h} \left((1 - h) \frac{\partial C^*}{\partial \ln(g)} + h \frac{\partial B}{\partial \ln(g)} \right) \\
&= \frac{\lambda}{h} \left( C^* \left( 1 - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \ln(g)} + \frac{\partial \ln(P)}{\partial \ln(g)} \right) + h \frac{\partial B}{\partial \ln(g)} \right)
\end{split}
\label{eq:dLdlng}
\end{equation}

Assuming farmers adopt only if $\partial \mathcal{L}^*/\partial \ln(g) \geq 0$ (this is implicit in axiom 2), then the adoption condition is

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\partial \ln(P) - \boldsymbol{\alpha} {'} \partial \ln(\mathbf{w}) + \partial \ln(g) + \frac{h}{C^*} \partial B &> 0 \\
\partial \ln(\nu) + \partial \ln(g) + \frac{h}{C^*} \partial B &> 0 \:\:;\:\:\: \partial \ln(\nu) = \partial \ln(P) - \boldsymbol{\alpha} {'} \partial \ln(\mathbf{w})
\end{split}
\label{eq:adoptCond}
\end{equation}

Where the term $\partial B$ represents the subsidies, costs, or any other exogenous mitigating circumstances, per unit area, entailed in the adoption of the technology package. In the absence of such mitigating circumstances, the condition simplifies to

\begin{equation}
\partial \ln(g) > -\partial \ln(\nu)
\label{eq:adoptCondSimp}
\end{equation}

As mentioned above, for SAI technologies the expectation is that $\partial \ln(P) < 0$, $\partial \ln(\mathbf{w}) > 0$, and thus $\partial \nu < 0$. In words, then, the adoption condition says that a farm stands to increase its net benefit through adoption of yield scaling technology only if the resulting percentage increase in TFP ($g$) is greater than the corresponding percentage decrease in output price minus the corresponding percentage increase in input prices scaled by their respective input elasticities ($\alpha_i$). Note the resemblance between this and the "price/productivity tightrope" condition formulated by Lipton [-@lipton2005family].

>\singlespacing "New [SAI] science usually raises farm supply of outputs and demand for inputs. That makes outputs cheaper and inputs more expensive; hence the ratio of farm output prices to input prices falls. Do small and poor farmers gain? If, and only if, this science-induced fall in their relative farm prices is slower than the science-induced rise in their conversion ratio of physical inputs into physical outputs (that is, TFP)."

\doublespacing

The only substantive difference between Lipton's condition and the condition in Inequality \ref{eq:adoptCondSimp} is that the percentage increases in input prices in the latter are scaled by their respective efficiency parameters. And of course the more complete version of the adoption condition in Inequality \ref{eq:adoptCond} differs from Lipton by also including the exogenous net subsidy term.

If the efficiency adjusted output-input price ratio decrease is greater than the increase in TFP ($g$), then the margin by which it is greater is the net subsidy term $h / C^* \partial B$ required to make adoption profitable. Note that the required net subsidy $\partial B$ will vary across farms based on $C^*$. The factor $h / C^*$, which may also be written $\lambda / R^*$, represents each farm's marginal valuation of the subsidy; and implies that the subsidy is relatively more valuable to farms with relatively lower expenditure. Solving Inequality \ref{eq:adoptCond} for $C^*$ gives the maximum expenditure level for which adoption is profitable if the (absolute value of the) efficiency adjusted output-input price ratio decrease is greater than the increase in TFP ($|\partial \ln(\nu)| > \partial \ln(g)$).

\begin{equation}
C^* \leq \frac{-h \partial B}{\partial \ln(\nu) + \partial \ln(g)}
\label{eq:cStarAdopt}
\end{equation}

If $\partial B=0$, then Inequality \ref{eq:adoptCond} implies that adoption will be either $0\%$ or $100\%$. Empirically, this is almost never observed. Adoption rates tend to fall somewhere between $0\%$ and $100\%$. The increased input demand associated with new technology adoption implies in and of itself that, without subsidies, $\partial B < 0$. And, of course, every major green revolution success story has involved subsidies of one kind or another to offset the required increase in input expenditure, and then some [@patel2013long; @pingali2012green]. (In his Nobel lecture, Norman Borlaug said that "equally as important as" the research product itself was the "sound governmental economic policy which would assure the farmer a fair price for his grain, the availability of the necessary inputs...and the credit with which to buy them" [-@Borlaug1970].) Within the theoretical framework developed here, this means that the net subsidy $\partial B$ is generally positive.
<!-- Equally as important as the transfer of the new seed and new technology from Mexico to India and Pakistan was the introduction from Mexico of a crop-production campaign strategy. This strategy harnessed the high grain-yield potential of the new seed and new technology to sound governmental economic policy which would assure the farmer a fair price for his grain, the availability of the necessary inputs – seed, fertilizers, insecticides, weed killers, and machinery – and the credit with which to buy them. Collectively these inputs and strategy became the base from which the green revolution evolved. -->
<!-- Assuming farms spend their whole farm budget ($B = C^*$), then the subsidy term simplifies to $h \partial \ln(C^*)$ and the adoption condition can be rewritten -->

Denoting the upper adoption bound on $C^*$ (Equation \ref{eq:cStarAdopt}) as $\bar{\bar{C^*}}$, the adoption rate $\mathcal{A}$ when $\partial \ln(g) < -\partial \ln(\nu)$ can be expressed as the integral of the density $\rho(C^*)$ over the domain $(0, \bar{\bar{C^*}})$.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A} = \int_0^{\bar{\bar{C^*}}} \rho(C^*) d C^*
\end{equation}

Because $C^*$ is lognormally distributed, the expression resolves as follows.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{A} &= \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(\bar{\bar{C^*}}) - m_c}{s_c} \right) \\
&= \Phi\left( \frac{\frac{-h \partial B}{\partial \ln(\nu) + \partial \ln(g)} - m_c}{s_c}
\end{split}
\label{eq:AdoptRate}
\end{equation}

The aggregate net subsidy required to reach this adoption rate can then be computed as the subsidy per unit area times the total farm area times the adoption rate.

\begin{equation}
\text{Aggregate net subsidy} = \partial B N E[k_a] \mathcal{A}
\label{eq:aggSubsidy}
\end{equation}

The adoption rate within single a binary endowment stratum can be calculated by evaluating this expression at the $v_{\ell}$ of interest.
<!-- aggSubsidy <- dB * Nf * muArea * adoptRateTotal * 10^-9 # Total subsidies in billions -->

## Aggregation of the endogenous farm supply response and change in welfare due to technology shocks \label{sec:aggImpact}
...second main contributution...
The total increase in aggregate supply due to a technology shock can be evaluated by integrating the change in farm production $\partial y^*$ over the density of adopting farms $(0, \bar{\bar{y^*}})$ where $\bar{\bar{y^*}} = y^*(\bar{\bar{C^*}})$.

$\overset{\triangle}{y}$

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta Q &= N \int_0^{\bar{\bar{y^*}}} k_a \partial \y^* \rho(y^*) dy^* \\
&= N E[k_a] \int_0^{\bar{\bar{y^*}}} y^* \partial \ln(y^*) \rho(y^*) dy^*
\end{split}
\end{equation}

From the expression for research induced yield change in Equations \ref{eq:dldlg0} it follows that

\begin{equation}
\partial \ln(y^*) = \frac{\ell}{1 - h} \:\:;\:\:\: \ell = \partial \ln(g) - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \partial \ln(\mathbf{w}) + h \partial \ln(P)
\end{equation}

Such that the integral reduces to

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta Q &= N E[k_a] \frac{\ell}{1 - h} \int_0^{\bar{\bar{y^*}}} y^* \rho(y^*) dy^* \\

The new aggregate supply curve ($Q'$) can then be evaluated as

\begin{equation}
Q' = Q + \Delta Q
\end{equation}

To assess the aggregate change in net benefit, note from Equation \ref{eq:dLdlng} that the farm level change in net benefit per unit area $\partial \mathcal{L}^*$ may be expressed

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\partial \mathcal{L}^* &= \frac{\lambda}{h} ( C^* (\partial g - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \partial \ln(\mathbf{w}) + \partial \ln(P)) + h \partial B) \\
&= r (C^* \gamma + h \partial B) \:\:;\:\:\: \gamma = \partial g - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \partial \ln(\mathbf{w}) + \partial \ln(P) \:\:\: r = \frac{\lambda}{h} = \fraC{P}{C^{\#}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

But recall from Equation \ref{eq:cStarAdopt} that $h \partial B = - \gamma \bar{\bar{C}^*}$, such that the expression reduces to

\begin{equation}
\partial \mathcal{L}^*(r, C^*) = r \gamma (C^* - \bar{\bar{C}^*})
\label{eq:dLstar}
\end{equation}

The aggregate change in net benefit ($\Delta \psi$) can be evaluated by integrating $\partial \mathcal{L}^*(C^*, r)$ over the farm expenditure ($C^* \in (0, \bar{\bar{C^{*h}}})$), revenue to expenditure ratio ($r \in (1, \infty)$) and area ($k_a$) densities. The domain of $r$ follows from axiom 3.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta \psi &= N \int_0^{\infty} \int_1^{\infty} \int_0^{\bar{\bar{C^*}}} \partial \mathcal{L}^*(C^*, r) \rho(C^*) dC^* \rho(r) dr \rho(k_a) d k_a \\

\end{split}
\end{equation}

But note that, by the symmetry of the normal cumulative distribution function,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Phi \left( \frac{\ln(P) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} + s_{\#} \right) &= 2 \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(P) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}}\right) - \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(P) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} - s_{\#} \right)\\
&= 2 \mathcal{E} - \mathcal{P}(P; m_{\#}, s_{\#})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Such that the previous equation reduces as follows.

\begin{equation}
\Delta \psi = N E[k_a] E[r] \gamma (2 \mathcal{E} - \mathcal{P}(P; m_{\#}, s_{\#})) ( E[C^*] \mathcal{P}(\bar{\bar{C}^*}; m_c, s_c)  - \bar{\bar{C}^*} \mathcal{A} )

<!-- $$ -->

By Equation \ref{eq:keyResult2}, this can also be written

\begin{equation}
\Delta \psi = N E[k_a] \gamma E[r | r \geq 1] \mathcal{A} \mathcal{E} (E[C^* | C^* \leq \bar{\bar{C}^*}] - \bar{\bar{C}^*})
\end{equation}

To calculate the change in aggregate supply and welfare for each stratum ($\Delta Q_{\ell}$ and $\Delta \psi_{\ell}$), in the equations above simply replace $v$, $N$, with $v_{\ell}$, $N_{\ell}$.

## Accounting for stochasticity, derivation of the expected aggregate supply curve based on axiom 5 \label{sec:acct4Stoch}

The deterministic aggregate supply function derived in section \ref{sec:addSupDet} is a suitable aggregate supply function in sectors characterized by deterministic production processes, negligible delays between input decisions and output, and negligible output price volatility. However, it is not suited to the primary sector, where production is partly deterministic but also partly a function of stochastic meteorological variables; where there is a significant delay between input decisions and output (i.e., the cropping season); and where output price volatility looms large in any management decision. In order to accommodate these hallmarks of agricultural supply, it is necessary to be more explicit in the treatment of yield and output price as stochastic variables.
<!-- Equation \ref{eq:aggSup1} -->

To begin with, yield is partly a function of stochastic meteorological variables unknown at planting time. Wherever $y^*$ appears in the equations above, what is really meant is $E[y^*(T)]|_{t = 0}$---that is to say, the farm's expectation of what yield will be at harvest time ($t = T$) as evaluated at planting time ($t = 0$). To arrive at an expression for $E[y^*(T)]|_{t = 0}$, consider observed yield at harvest.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
y^*(T; k_m(T)) &= y^*(T) = E[y^*(T; k_m(T))] \frac{k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}}{E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]} \frac{k'}{E[k']} \frac{C^{*h}}{E[C^{*h}]} \:\:;\:\:\: k' = k_m(T)^{-\kappa_m} k \\
&= v \frac{k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}}{E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]} k' C^{*h} \:\:;\:\:\: v = \frac{E[y^*(T)]}{E[k'] E[C^{*h}]}
\end{split}
\label{eq:yStarT}
\end{equation}

Where the stochastic meteorological component $k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}$ has been factored out of $k$. The component $k_m(T)$ may be a single stochastic meteorological component such as total rainfall by harvest time, or it may represent a product of cumulative meteorological variables raised to their respective elasticities. For example, if the key meteorological variables are rainfall and solar radiation, then $k_m(T)^{\kappa_m} = k_r(T)^{\kappa_r} k_s(T)^{\kappa_s}$, where $k_r(T)$ and $k_s(T)$ are cumulative rainfall and solar radiation at harvest.

Taking the stochastic expectation of Equation \ref{eq:yStarT} then gives an expression for expected yield $E[y^*(T)]|_{t = 0}$.

\begin{equation}
E[y^*(T; k_m)]|_{t = 0} = E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m)]|_{t = 0} \left[\frac{k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}}{E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]} \right]\Big|_{t = 0} \frac{k'}{E[k']} \frac{C^{*h}}{E[C^{*h}]} \:\:;\:\:\: \tilde{y}^*(T; k_m) = E[y^*(T; k_m)]
\label{eq:EyStarT0}
\end{equation}

Note that taking the population mean of both sides of this equation results in a useful expression.

\begin{equation}
E[E[y^*(T; k_m)]|_{t = 0}] = E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m)]|_{t = 0}
\end{equation}

This result, which can also be reached by invoking Fubini's theorem, maps the mean expected yield to the expected yield on the mean farm---i.e., the farm where $k = E[k]$ and $C^{*h} = E[C^{*h}]$.

Farm data reports harvest yield $y^*(T)$, but expected yield at planting time ($E[y^*(T; k_m)]|_{t = 0}$) is generally not observable. Nonetheless, the implicit observed mean expected yield can be calculated from fitted $v$ and observed $E[k']$ and $E[C^{*h}|\theta]$, for a given mean expected meteorological condition. To see this, note that, by Fubini's theorem, the mean expected meteorological condition may be expressed

\begin{equation}
E[E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]|_{t = 0}] = E[\tilde{k_m}(T)^{\kappa_m}]|_{t = 0} \:\:;\:\:\: \tilde{k_m}(T)^{\kappa_m} = E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]
\end{equation}

Such that the implicit observed mean expected yield can be written

\begin{equation}
E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m)|\theta]|_{t = 0} = v E[\tilde{k}_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]|_{t = 0} E[k'] E[C^{*h}|\theta]
\label{eq:impMuEyStarT0cond}
\end{equation}
<!-- ...in section \ref{sec:condMean}, tractable expression for mean yield, stochastic version -->
<!-- ... -->
<!-- The relation between conditional and unconditional mean yield (Equation \ref{eq:condMeanYd1}) can thus be rewritten as follows. -->

<!-- E[y^*] = E[y^*|C^{\#} \leq P] \frac{\mathcal{E}}{\mathcal{P}} -->
<!-- \label{eq:condMeanYd2} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- ... -->
<!-- In practice, $E[y^*(T; k_m(T))]|_{t = 0}$ is generally not observable.

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- E[y^*(T; k_m(T))]|_{t = 0} = \frac{E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]|_{t = 0}}{k_r(T)^{\kappa_m}} y^*(T; k_r(T)) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- Combining the previous two equations gives a formula for calculating expected yield at a specific expected meteorological condiion $E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]|_{t = 0}$ based on observed yield $y^*(T)$ and meteorology $k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}$. -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- E[y^*(T)]|_{t = 0} = \frac{E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]|_{t = 0}}{k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}} y^*(T) -->

<!-- Because the unconditional mean yield does not change $\tilde{y}^*(T) = E[\tilde{y}^*(T)]|_{t = 0}$, [changes in weather affect both identically] -->
<!-- The term $E[E[y^*(T)]|_{t = 0}]$ is the population mean of the expectation of the stochastic process $y^*(t)$.  This can be rewritten in more expedient notation by evaluating the population mean of both sides,  -->

<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- And then taking the stochastic expectation -->

<!-- \label{eq:stochYd2} -->

The optimal farm expenditure per acre $C^*$ remains a deterministic variable because it refers primarily to land preparation, seed, fertilizer and chemical pest control. Some formulations of farm cost might also include some harvest post harvest labor costs (e.g., shelling, stooking, transport), but the main cost components are typically known (executed or committed) at planting time.

Absent a forward contract, the output sale price $P$ is a stochastic variable unknown to the farmer at the time of planting. Wherever $P$ appears in the equations above, then, what is really meant is $E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}$---the value that the farmer expects $P$ to take at harvest/sale, as evaluated at planting time. To parse $E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}$, a suitable stochastic model must be assumed for $P(t)$. Within a given season, prices often follow a geometric Brownian motion (gBm). That is to say, changes in $P$ over a small time interval $\Delta t$ ($\Delta P = P(t + \Delta t) - P(t)$) are often accurately modeled by

\begin{equation}
\Delta P = P(t) m_p \Delta t - P(t) s_p \varepsilon \sqrt{\Delta t}
\end{equation}

Where $\varepsilon$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $1$, such that the arithmetic change $\Delta P / P$ is normally distributed with mean and variance

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E \left[\frac{\Delta P(T)}{P(T)} \right] &= m_{p} \Delta t  \\
Var \left[\frac{\Delta P(T)}{P(T)} \right] &= s_{p}^2 \Delta t
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Such that the expected value of $P(T)$ resolves as

\begin{equation}
E[P(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0} = P(0) e^{m_p T}
\label{eq:EPT0}
\end{equation}

(For details, see Hull [-@hull9thEdition].)

The choice of gBm as the stochastic model for $P(t)$ is axiom 5. For what follows, it is important to note that the log change of the gBm $\ln(P(T) / P(\hat{t}))$ is defined over any finite time interval for some starting time $\hat{t}<T$, and is also normally distributed, with mean and variance

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E \left[\ln \left( \frac{P(T)}{P(\hat{t})} \right) \right] &= \left(m_{p} - \frac{s_p^2}{2} \right) T \\
Var \left[\ln \left( \frac{P(T)}{P(\hat{t})} \right) \right] &= Var \left[\ln (P(T)) \right] = s_{p}^2 T
\label{eq:lnChngP}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

For those unfamiliar with stochastic modeling but familiar with statistics, the choice of stochastic model may be roughly thought of as the choice of size distribution of changes in $P(t)$ per small time increment $\Delta t$. Selecting gBm as the stochastic model of $P(t)$ is tantamount to assuming that such changes are lognormally distributed. Some examples of maize prices following a gBm are given in Figure \ref{fig:gBmPrice}, accompanied by histograms of their log changes per time step. The histograms offer visual confirmation that price changes per time step are convergent to a lognormal distribution, and that gBm is therefore a reasonable assumption.

It is important to keep in mind that the price trajectory considered here is over a cropping season---from planting to harvest. When considered over multiple cropping seasons, prices typically exhibit cyclic or mean reverting behavior, which requires a more sophisticated stochastic model.
<!-- Finally, note that $\Delta t$ is technically an instantaneous time interval, such that $m_p$ is the expected instantaneous growth rate. In practice, it is often acceptable to treat $\Delta t$ as a finitely small, but judicious, time step. As a rule of thumb, $\Delta t$ should be as small as the resolution of the data will allow, while also ensuring a finite sample path with no jumps. -->

Farm cost per acre is deterministic, but optimal unit expenditure $C^{\#}$ is proportional to price, and must therefore also be stochastic. Rewriting Equation \ref{eq:cSharp} in stochastically explicit terms,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[C^{\#}(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0} &= \frac{E[P(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}}{\lambda} h \\
&= \frac{P(0) e^{m_p T}}{\lambda} h
\end{split}
\label{eq:useful2}
\end{equation}

Substituting the stochastic terms developed above for $y^*$, $P$, and $C^{\#}$ in the deterministic aggregate supply curve (Equation \ref{eq:aggSup1}), gives the _expected_ aggregate supply curve.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[Q(T)]|_{t = 0} = N E[k_a] E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m(T))]|_{t = 0} \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} - \eta s_{\#} \right) \\
m_{\#} = E[\ln(E[C^{\#}(T)]|_{t = 0})] \:\:\:\: s^2_{\#} = Var\ln(E[C^{\#}(T)]|_{t = 0})
\end{split}
\label{eq:aggSup2}
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:condMeanYd1}, relating the observed (conditional) mean and unconditional mean expected yield, must also be rewritten more carefully as follows.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m(T))]|_{t = 0} &= E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m(T)) | \theta]|_{t = 0} \frac{\Phi\left( \frac{\ln(E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} \right)}{\Phi \left( \frac{\ln(E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} - \eta s_{\#} \right)} \\
& \theta = E[C^{\#}(T)]|_{t = 0} \leq E[P(T)]|_{t = 0} \\
& \tilde{y}^*(T; k_r(T))|\{\theta\} = E[y^*(T; k_r(T)) | \theta]
\end{split}
\label{eq:condMeanYd2}
\end{equation}

In practice, the expected conditional mean yield ($E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m(T)) | \theta]|_{t = 0}$) is generally not observable. However, it can be estimated from the observed (conditional) mean harvest yield ($E[y^*(T; k_m(T))|\theta]$) as follows.

\begin{equation}
E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m(T)) | \theta]|_{t = 0} = \frac{E[E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]]|_{t = 0}}{E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]} E[y^*(T; k_m(T))|\theta]
\label{eq:EmuYstarCondEst}
\end{equation}
<!-- \begin{split} -->
<!-- E[E[y^*(T)]|_{t = 0}] &= E[E[y^*(T)]|_{t = 0} | \theta] -->
<!-- \frac{\Phi\left( \frac{\ln(P) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} \right)}{\Phi \left( \frac{\ln(P) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} - \eta s_{\#} \right)} \\ -->

It was noted earlier that the $\Phi()$ term in the numerator on the righthand side of Equation \ref{eq:condMeanYd2} may be interpreted as the farm employment rate. In the remainder of this section, it is shown that the $\Phi()$ term appearing in the denominator, and in the expected aggregate supply function, also has a meaningful economic interpretation. Specifically,

\begin{equation}
\Phi \left( \frac{\ln(E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} - \eta s_{\#} \right) = \text{Prob}(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0} \leq P(T)^{\eta}) \:\:;\:\:\: \tilde{C}^{\#}(T) = E[C^{\#}(T)]
\label{eq:probProfitResult}
\end{equation}

In words, the $\Phi()$ term on the lefthand side equals the probability that the harvest output price (raised to $\eta$) will be greater than the mean farm's expected unit cost (raised to $\eta$). The term may thus be considered a rough reflection (up to the adjustment $\eta$) of the mean probability of profit. To see this, start with the expectation of Equation \ref{eq:useful2}, giving the population mean of $E[C^{\#}(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}$.

\begin{equation}
E[E[C^{\#}(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}] = E[P(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0} h E[\lambda^{-1}]
\end{equation}

But note also that

\begin{equation}
E[C^{\#}(T)] = P(T) h E[\lambda^{-1}]
\end{equation}

Such that

\begin{equation}
E[E[C^{\#}(T)]]\bigr|_{t = 0} = E[P(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0} h E[\lambda^{-1}]
\end{equation}

Then it follows that

\begin{equation}
E[E[C^{\#}(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}] = E[E[C^{\#}(T)]]\bigr|_{t = 0}
\label{eq:fubThm}
\end{equation}

Which is a result that can again also be reached by invoking Fubini's theorem. To be clear, the result states that the population mean of the optimal expected unit cost ($E[C^{\#}(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}$) is equal to the optimal expected unit cost on the mean farm, i.e. the farm with $\lambda^{-1} = E[\lambda^{-1}]$. It therefore maps the mean of all $C^{\#}(t)$ trajectories in the farm population to the mean of possible random trajectories on a single farm (the farm where $\lambda^{-1} = E[\lambda^{-1}]$). Letting $\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)$ denote the unit cost on the mean farm (i.e. $\tilde{C}^{\#}(T) = C^{\#}(T)|_{\lambda^{-1} = E[\lambda^{-1}]}$), an equivalent, perhaps clearer, way of writing the result is
<!-- reference justifying application of Fubini's thm here: -->
<!-- https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/412936/when-can-integration-and-expectation-be-exchanged -->
<!-- [GRAPHIC showing equality of pop mean of expected future cSharp to expected cSharp on the mean farm (?)] -->

\begin{equation}
E[E[C^{\#}(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}] = E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}
\label{eq:fubThm2}
\end{equation}

Where the righthand side has been rewritten to more clearly indicate future expectation on the single farm where $\lambda^{-1} = E[\lambda^{-1}]$.

Switching from population parameter space to stochastic price parameter space also requires that the variance likewise switches from a population variance to a stochastic variance. This means replacing $Var[\ln(E[C^{\#}(T)]|_{t = 0})]$ (i.e. $s^2_{\#}$) with $Var[\ln(\tilde{C}^{\#}(T))]|_{t = 0}$. 

To parse $Var[\ln(\tilde{C}^{\#}(T))]|_{t = 0}$, note first that the optimal expected unit cost $E[C^{\#}(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}$ is an abstract optimal target that farmers aim for, but that evolves before and after the actual farm expenditure that is "locked in" at planting based on the price information $P(0)$ available at that time. As an abstract target, then, optimal unit cost may be expressed

\begin{equation}
C^{\#}(t) = P(t) \frac{h}{\lambda}
\label{eq:useful3}
\end{equation}

Because its evolution is proportional to output price, then, by Ito's Lemma, $C^{\#}(t)$ must also be a gBm with the same drift and volatility parameters as $P(t)$. (A proof of this is given in Appendix B.) Therefore,

\begin{equation}
Var[\ln(C^{\#}(T))]\bigr|_{t = 0} = s^2_p T
\label{eq:sPTresult}
\end{equation}

This is true for any value of $\lambda^{-1}$, including $\lambda^{-1} = E[\lambda^{-1}]$. Thus, when moving from farm population space to stochastic price space, $s^2_{\#}$ becomes $s^2_p T$.

As for $m_{\#}$, recall that the $m_{\#}$ in the $\Phi()$ term in Equation \ref{eq:aggSup2} comes from the definition $E[C^{\# \eta}] = e^{\eta m_{\#} + \eta^2 s^2_{\#} / 2}$ such that $m_{\#} = \ln(E[C^{\# \eta}]) - \eta s^2_{\#} / 2$. The results in Equations \ref{eq:fubThm2} and \ref{eq:sPTresult} mean that $m_{\#}$ also has the following dual expression in stochastic price space.

\begin{equation}
m_{\#} = \ln(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}) - \eta \frac{s^2_p}{2} T
\end{equation}

Substituting the dual expressions for $m_{\#}$ and $s^2_{\#}$ in the $\Phi()$ term of Equation \ref{eq:probProfitResult}, and substituting $P(0)e^{m_p T}$ for $E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}$ (via Equation \ref{eq:EPT0}), resolves the $\Phi()$ term as follows.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Phi \left( \frac{\ln(E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}) - m_{\#}}{s_{\#}} - \eta s_{\#} \right) &= \Phi \left( \frac{\ln(P(0)) + m_p T - \ln(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}) + \eta \frac{s^2_p}{2} T}{s_p \sqrt{T}} - \eta s_p \sqrt{T} \right) \\
&= \Phi \left( -\frac{\ln \left(\frac{E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}}{P(0)} \right) - \left( m_p - \eta \frac{s^2_p}{2} \right) T}{s_p \sqrt{T}} \right) \\
&= 1 - \Phi(z) \:\:;\:\:\: z = \frac{\ln \left(\frac{E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}}{P(0)} \right) - \left( m_p - \eta \frac{s^2_p}{2} \right) T}{s_p \sqrt{T}}
\end{split}
\label{eq:PhiMap}
\end{equation}

But note that $z$ is just the standard score of logged output price evaluated at $\ln(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0})$. (Recall Equations \ref{eq:lnChngP}.)

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \begin{split} -->
<!-- z &= \frac{\ln \left(\frac{E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}}{P(0)} \right) - \left( m_p - \eta \frac{s^2_p}{2} \right) T}{s_p \sqrt{T}} \\ -->
<!-- &= \frac{\ln(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}) - \ln(P(0)) - \left( m_p - \eta \frac{s^2_p}{2} \right) T}{s_p \sqrt{T}} -->
<!-- \end{split} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
z &= \frac{\ln \left(\frac{E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}}{P(0)} \right) - \left( m_p - \eta \frac{s^2_p}{2} \right) T}{s_p \sqrt{T}} \\
&= \frac{\ln(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}) - \ln(P(0)) - \left( m_p - \eta \frac{s^2_p}{2} \right) T}{s_p \sqrt{T}}  \\
&= \frac{\ln(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}) - E[\ln(P(T))]|_{t = 0}}{s_p \sqrt{T}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Therefore

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
1 - \Phi(z) &= \text{Prob}(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0} \leq P(T)^{\eta}) \\
& \equiv \mathcal{P}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Which proves Equation \ref{eq:probProfitResult}. Recalling from section \ref{sec:axioms1and2} that the adjustment $\eta$ is the output price elasticity of farm supply (PEFS), the probability $\mathcal{P}$ is henceforth referred to as the "PEFS-adjusted mean probability of profit". Equation \ref{eq:PhiMap} maps the PEFS-adjusted mean probability of profit from farm population parameter space to stochastic price parameter space. The most appropriate parameter space to work in is that for which the higher resolution data is available. When farm data is available, evaluation in farm population parameter space is the best approach. In the absence of farm data, evaluation in stochastic price parameter space is appropriate if high resolution price series data is available.

Expected aggregate supply in stochastic price parameter space follows from Equations \ref{eq:aggSup2} and \ref{eq:PhiMap}.

\begin{equation}
E[Q(T)]|_{t = 0} = N E[k_a] E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m(T))]|_{t = 0} (1 - \Phi(z)) \:\:;\:\:\: z = \frac{\ln \left( \frac{E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0}}{P(0)} \right) - \left( m_p - \eta \frac{s^2_p}{2} \right) T}{s_p \sqrt{T}}
\label{eq:aggSup3}
\end{equation}

Where the expected unconditional mean yield in stochastic price parameter space is

\begin{equation}
E[\tilde{y}^*(T)]|_{t = 0} = E[\tilde{y}^*(T) | \theta]|_{t = 0} \frac{1 - \Phi(z - \eta s_p \sqrt{T})}{1 - \Phi(z)}
\label{eq:condMeanYd3}
\end{equation}

And, regardless of the parameter space in which calculations are made,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[Q(T)]|_{t = 0} &= N E[k_a] E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_m(T))]|_{t = 0} \text{Prob}(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0} \leq P(T)^{\eta}) \\
&= N E[k_a] E[\tilde{y}^*(T)]|_{t = 0} \times \text{PEFS-adj. mean probability of profit}
\end{split}
\label{eq:aggSup4}
\end{equation}

And

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[\tilde{y}^*(T)]|_{t = 0} &= E[\tilde{y}^*(T) | \theta]|_{t = 0} \frac{\text{Prob}(E[C^{\#}(T)]|_{t = 0} \leq P(T))}{\text{Prob}(E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)^{\eta}]|_{t = 0} \leq P(T)^{\eta})} \\
\text{Expected undonditional mean yield} &= \text{Expected conditional mean yield} \times \frac{\text{Farm employment rate}}{\text{PEFS-adj. mean probability of profit}}
\end{split}
\label{eq:muEyStarT0frommuEyStarT0trunc}
\end{equation}
<!-- \text{Mean expected undonditional yield} &= \text{Mean expected conditional yield} -->

In the absence of both farm and price data, then, back of the envelope calculations can be made based on expert consensus regarding mean observed (conditional) yield, the farm employment rate, and the PEFS adjusted mean probability of profit.

Note that the price elasticity of expected aggregate supply follows as

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \ln(E[Q(T)]|_{t = 0})}{\partial \ln(P(0))} &= \frac{d \ln (\Phi(-z))}{d (-z)} \frac{\partial (-z)}{\partial \ln(P(0))} \\
&= \frac{\phi(-z)}{\Phi(-z)} \frac{1}{s_p \sqrt{T}}
\end{split}
\label{eq:pElasQagg}
\end{equation}

Whereby it is clear that, under axioms 1-5, price elasticity of expected aggregate supply changes with price, contrary to the assumption in many economic surplus analyses. It follows, moreover, that aggregate supply is elastic/inelastic if

\begin{equation}
s_p \sqrt{T} </> \frac{\phi(-z)}{\Phi(-z)}
\end{equation}

Finally, the stochastically explicit formulations for the research induced change in aggregate supply and welfare derived in section \ref{sec:aggImpact} follow from the exposition above as

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Delta E[Q(T; k_m(T))]|_{t = 0} &= N E[k_a] E[\tilde{y}^*(T, k_m(T))]|_{t = 0} \frac{1}{1 - h}(\partial \ln(g) - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \partial \ln(\mathbf{w})) \mathcal{P} \\
&= N \mathcal{A} E[k_a] E[\tilde{y}^*(T, k_m(T))| C^* \leq \bar{\bar{C^*}}]|_{t = 0} \frac{1}{1 - h}(\partial \ln(g) - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \partial \ln(\mathbf{w}))
\end{split}
\label{eq:dEQT0}
\end{equation}
<!-- \Delta Q = N E[k_a] E[y^*] \frac{\ell}{1 - h}\mathcal{P}(\bar{\bar{C^{*h}}}; m_c, s_c) -->

And

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \begin{split} -->
<!-- \Delta \psi &= N E[k_a] E[k] v P \gamma (E[C^{*h}] \mathcal{P}() - \bar{\bar{C^{*h}}} \mathcal{A}) \\ -->
<!-- &= N E[k_a] P \gamma \left( E[y^*] \mathcal{P} - E[\overline{\overline{E[y(T)^*]|_{t = 0}}}] \mathcal{A} \right) -->

# An illustrative use case: Kenya's maize aggregate supply curve

## Expected aggregate supply model parameter estimation and comparison to empirical estimates

As an illustrative example, the expected aggregate supply curve derived above from axioms 1-5 is fit to 2007 Kenyan maize farm data and compared against empirical estimates of expected aggregate supply for the years 2006-2012. The farm data used in this pedagogical exercise come from a panel covering the main and short rains seasons for multiple crops across Kenya for the years 1997, 2000, 2004, 2007, and 2010, originally gathered by the Egerton University Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development in partnership with Michigan State University, under the auspices of a USAID project [@maizeData]. For the present exercise, only the 2007 main rains season maize farm data is used. The main season in Kenya generally runs from March to August or September. Farms not reporting maize as their main crop or reporting zero maize production cost are excluded, as well as five farms reporting extremely high unit cost, resulting in a sample size of 937 maize farms across 20 districts (nowadays referred to as "counties"). The sample represents all major maize growing regions in the country. Full details regarding the data and its processing for the present exercise, including summary statistics, are provided in Appendix B.

The empirical estimates of aggregate supply for the years 2006-2012 are taken from commodity intelligence reports published in mid to late season---prior to harvest but after planted area and main season rainfall are known. These estimates, summarized in Table 1, cover some of Kenya's worst drought years in living memory.

To estimate the parameters of expected aggregate supply curve, Equation \ref{eq:yStarT} (in logs) is fit to the farm data by OLS regression.

\begin{equation}
\ln(y^*(T)) &= \ln(v) + \sum_i^{n_k} \kappa_i \ln(k_i) + h \ln(C^*) + \epsilon
\label{eq:lYstarT}
\end{equation}
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- y^*(T; k_m(T)) = y^*(T) = E[y^*(T; k_m(T))] \frac{k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}}{E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]} \frac{k'}{E[k']} \frac{C^{*h}}{E[C^{*h}]} \:\:;\:\:\: k' = k_m(T)^{-\kappa_m} k \\ -->
<!-- = v \frac{k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}}{E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]} k' C^{*h} \:\:;\:\:\: v = \frac{E[y^*(T)]}{E[k'] E[C^{*h}]} -->
<!-- $$ -->

Where $\epsilon$ is the regression residual. Recall from the exposition in section \ref{sec:axioms1and2} that the regression constant $\ln(v)$ captures the (logged) expenditure TFP, and is related to the (logged) TFP $\ln(g)$ as follows.

\begin{equation}
\ln(v) = \ln(a) + \ln(g) \:\:;\:\:\: \ln(a) &= \sum_i^{n_x} \ln \left( \frac{\alpha_i}{w_i} \right)^{\alpha_i} - \ln(h)
\end{equation}

Where TFP may include binary endowment variables that augment the constant on farms where the endowment is present (Equation \ref{eq:g0Sum}, replicated here for convenience).

$$
\ln(g) = \beta_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n_b} \beta_i b_i \:\:;\:\:\: n_b = 4
$$
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \ln(g) = \alpha_0 = \beta_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n_b} b_i \beta_i -->
<!-- \label{eq:g0Sum} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:axioms1and2}, in this exercise there are four binary endowment variables $b_i$ (which take a value of $1$ if the endowment is present and $0$ otherwise) are: use of oxen in land preparation, use of tractor in land preparation, use of hybrid seed, and land tenure. There are 12 unique combinations of these four endowments in the data. The control variables ($k_i$) are planting density (seed kg/acre), adult equivalent household size, farm size, and rainfall. The rainfall variable is 2007 main season rainfall divided by an historical benchmark, and so can be interpreted as the rainfall anomaly or departure from the historical benchmark. The farm expenditure $C^*$ includes the cost of synthetic fertilizer, land preparation, pest and disease control chemicals, and seed. The OLS regression results are presented in Table 2.

The fitted coefficient on logged cost per acre is statistically significant and indicates that the population yield degree of homogeneity is $h =$ `r hReport`, by which it follows immediately that the price elasticity of farm supply is $\eta = h / (1 - h) =$ `r etaReport`. The coefficients on the other regressors are also statistically significant and take values and signs that agree with intuition. Note that the coefficient on the farm size regressor is negative, affirming the inverse relation between farm size and yield found in numerous other studies [@muyanga2019revisiting; @larson2014should; @wassie2019revisiting; @gautam2019too; @kimhi2006plot].

The fitted binary endowment coefficients ($\beta_i$) indicate that hybrid maize seed is the most significant contributor to TFP, followed by land prep method and tenure. Interestingly, oxen contributes slightly more than tractor. Based on these values, the expenditure TFPs are calculated for each of the 12 binary endowment strata ($v_{\ell}$), as well as the average across all strata ($v$). The implicit mean expected yield ($E[\tilde{y}^*(T;k_r) | \theta] |_{t = 0}$) is then calculated by Equation \ref{eq:impMuEyStarT0cond}, for $\tilde{k}_r^{\kappa_r} = 1$ (indicating rainfall expectation in line with the historical benchmark). These stratified and whole sample parameters are reported along with the mean observed cost per unit area and harvest yield in Table 2.

comment on higher yield of tractor but higher efficiency of oxen
harvest was higher than expected, implicit expected yield based on kr=1 when in fact kr > 1 (graphic)-- expected less got more hence harvest yield higher than implicit expected yield at $\tilde{k}_r^{\kappa_r}=1$.

To evaluate the expected unconditional mean yield term ($E[\tilde{y}^*(T)]|_{t = 0}$) and parameters $m_{\#}$, $s_{\#}$ appearing in the expected aggregate supply expression (Equation \ref{eq:aggSup2}), first the conditional parameters $\bar{m}_{\#}$ and $\bar{s}_{\#}$ are calculated from the fitted values $v$ and $h$, and the sample parameters $\bar{m}_c$, $\bar{s}_c$, $m_k$, and $s_k$, as explained in section \ref{sec:evalInPract}. The expected price at planting time ($E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}$) for the year of the data is also required.
<!-- by Equation \ref{eq:mCshrpsCshrp} -->
<!-- as explained in \ref{sec:farmResp} -->
<!-- as explained in \ref{sec:adopt} -->

The Kenya farm data includes the harvest output price as observed at harvest $P(T)$, but not $E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}$. Recall from Equation \ref{eq:EPT0} that calculation of $E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}$ requires the maize price at planting $P(0)$, the drift parameter $m_p$, and the time from planting to harvest $T$. In the present exercise, this information is taken from the World Food Program main season monthly price series plotted in Figure \ref{fig:mzP} [@WFPpriceData]. Given the monthly time step of the data, the time horizon from planting in March to the August-September harvest is $T = 6$. The price at planting $P(0)$ is averaged over the main maize markets. The drift parameter $m_p$ is then calculated as the mean log change from one month to another in all markets. Missing values are omitted from these calculations.

When calculating $m_p$, it is important to take note of price dynamics peculiar to the market in question. In Kenya, the short rains maize crop is harvested about a month before the main season crop is planted. If the short rains harvest is good, then the maize price tends to remain flat during the main season or decrease a little. If the short rains harvest is poor, then the price tends to trend upwards during the main season and to be a little more volatile. This is reflected in Figure \ref{fig:mzP}, where the price series in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012 are upward trending. It is known that the main season followed a poor short rains harvest in these years. In the other years, the price series are flat because the short rains harvest was normal. To accommodate this dichotomy, $m_P$ is calculated separately for bad short rain years and good short rain years. For years beginning with a bad short rains harvest, the expected price is calculated using the "bad short rains" $m_p$, while expected price in years beginning with a good short rains harvest is calculated using the "good short rains" $m_p$.
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \begin{split} -->
<!-- E[E[C^{\#}(T)]|_{t = 0}| \theta] &= E \left[ \frac{C^*}{E[y^*(T; k_m(T))]|_{t = 0}}  \right] \\ -->
<!-- &= \fracE[C^*] -->
<!-- \end{split} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- E[\tilde{y}^*(T)|{\theta}]|_{t = 0} -->
<!-- As explained in \ref{sec:aggSupDeterm}, axiom 3 truncates the observed distribution of optimal expected unit cost at the expected output price. The conditional parameters $\bar{m}_{\#}$ and $\bar{s}_{\#}$ are calculated from this observed, truncated distribution; and then  -->
<!-- When taking account of stochasticity, the unconditional mean $E[y^*]$ in the deterministic aggregate supply expression (Equation \ref{eq:aggSup1}) is replaced with the stochastic expectation of the unconditional mean yield $E[\tilde{y}^*(T)]|_{t = 0}$. For purposes of parameterization, this can be calculated from the known value $E[k_m(T)^{\kappa_m}]$, the expectation $E[\widetilde{k_r(T)^{\kappa_r}}]|_{t = 0}$, and the unconditional mean at harvest. -->
<!-- Where the unconditional mean yield $E[y^*(T)]$ is calculated from the conditional mean as explained in the previous section. -->
<!-- Farmers base expectations of harvest price on most recent price movement, adaptive expectation [@onono2013response].  -->

<!-- 2006 12 Jun - Good rain [GIEWS]. -->
<!-- 2007 15 May assessment - long rains were delayed and short rains harvest delayed due to unseasonal extension of short rains into February. This initially led to reduced main season planting, but then good rains came and planting increased. [GIEWS/MoA 2007]. -->

<!-- Calculation of $m_{\#}$ and $s_{\#}$ requires the expected price at planting for 2007, the same year as the farm data used to estimate $\bar{m}_{\#}$ and $\bar{s}_{\#}$. -->
The short rains harvest in 2007 was normal and so the "good short rains" estimate of $m_p$, and March 2007 price is used to compute $E[P(T)]|_{t = 0} = P(0) e^{m_p T}$ (where $P(0)$ is the price at planting in March), which then feeds into the calculation of the unconditional parameters $m_{\#}$ and $s_{\#}$ by simultaneous Equations \ref{eq:cSharpUncondParams}.

Once $m_{\#}$ and $s_{\#}$ are calculated, the expected unconditional mean yield term ($E[\tilde{y}^*(T; k_r(T))]|_{t = 0}$) required to evaluate aggregate supply is calculated by Equation \ref{eq:impMuEyStarT0uncond} at four different expected rainfall levels: $E[E[k_r(T)^{\kappa_r}]]|_{t = 0} = 1.5^{\kappa_r}, \: 1^{\kappa_r}, \: 0.5^{\kappa_r}, \: 0.1^{\kappa_r}$. These values correspond to expected rainfall that is 150% of the historical benchmark ("high"), in line with the historical benchmark ("normal"), 50% of the historical benchmark ("low"), and 10% of the historical benchmark ("dismal"), respectively.
<!-- follows from Equation \ref{eq:condMeanYd2}. In the process, the farm employment rate is calculated as $\mathcal{E}=$ `r round(EmploymentRate, 2)` and the PEFS adjusted mean probability of profit is calculated as `r round(ProbProfit, 2)`. -->

The two remaining parameters required to evaluate expected aggregate supply in Equation \ref{eq:aggSup2} are number of farms $N$ and mean farm size $k_a$. For mean farm size, the Kenya farm sample mean is used, giving $k_a =$ `r muAreaReport` acres. The number of maize farms is more difficult to assess. One sometimes sees the figure $3$ million mentioned [e.g. @njeru2022maize], but this appears to be unsupported by any hard evidence. Here, a rough estimate is deduced by dividing planted area by mean farm size. The midseason reports examined for this exercise suggest that planted main season maize area during the period in question ranges between 3 and 4.5 million acres [@KFSSGJul2011]. Divided by $k_a$, this gives a range between $1.56$ and $2.34$ million farms. The figure $N =$ `r NfReport` million is used as a rough estimate.

With all the necessary parameters estimated, the theoretical expected aggregate supply curve developed in the sections above is plotted at the four expected rainfall levels, with empirical aggregate supply estimates overlaid, in the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:EaggQs}. The empirical estimates for the major drought years agree closely with the theoretical expected supply curve evaluated at the "dismal" rainfall level, while the estimates in normal or good rainfall years generally agree with the theoretical curve evaluated at the "normal" and "high" rainfall levels. The curve overshoots the 2010 estimate somewhat, possibly due to crop loss from flooding that year [@GIEWS5Aug2010]. The one major empirical divergence from the theoretical curve is 2009, an historic drought year [@MoApressRelease2009].

The price elasticity of expected aggregate supply curve is presented in the bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:EaggQs}. Empirical estimates of the maize price elasticity of supply in Kenya generally range from $0.1$ to $0.365$ [@abodi2021supply; @onono2013response; @olwande2009supply], which is roughly the range of elasticities indicated by the theoretical curve for the years examined here.
<!-- In one study, Onono et al.'s estimate of price elasticity of supply: 0.365 [@onono2013response] -->

A key message emerging from these results is that aggregate supply varies widely with meteorological conditions. Individual supply curves represent specific scenarios within a broad range of such scenarios. It may thus more instructive to speak of a supply range or "ribbon", bounded by supply curves on top and bottom representing best and worst case meteorological scenarios.

Finally, it is important to keep in mind that the expected aggregate supply and price elasticity curves parameterized in this exercise are "short run" curves in the sense that they are valid only insofar as the values of their fitted parameters---$h$, $N$, $k_a$, $k$, $m_{\#}$, $s_{\#}$, $m_p$---are accurate. Empirical estimates for years well before or well after the year of the data used to estimate the parameters can be expected to diverge from the curve.

Say a new technology package is released in Kenya that results in a `r 100 * dlng0`% increase in TFP on adopting farms. As explained in section \ref{sec:farmResp}, this is tantamount to adding another binary endowment $b_5\beta_5 =$ `r round(betaNew, 2)` to the yield model. Say that the expected $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-adjusted percentage increase in input prices ($\boldsymbol{\alpha} '\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})$) is `r aDotdlw`, and the expected percentage decrease in output price ($\partial \ln(P)$) is `r dlP`, such that $\partial \ln(\nu) =$ `r dlnNu`, which is greater than the percentage increase in TFP. Adoption would thus result in a `r 100 * dlv0dlg0`% increase in expenditure TFP ($v$), a `r -round(100 * dlMuCstar)`% reduction in expenditure, and a `r round(100 * dlMuEyStarT0)`% increase in yield on adopting farms (recall Equations \ref{eq:dlv0dlg0}, \ref{eq:dlyStardlg0}, and \ref{eq:dlCstardlg0}). However, by the criterion in Inequality \ref{eq:adoptCondSimp}, adoption makes economic sense for the farmer only if a net subsidy is included in the technology package (i.e., only if $\partial B > 0$).

Say that the Ministry of Agriculture offers a net subsidy of $\partial B = $ `r dB` KES/acre to adopting farms, perhaps in the form of free seed and fertilizer. As explained in section \ref{sec:adopt}, this then implies the adoption expenditure per acre ceiling of $\bar{\bar{C}^*} =$ `r round(cStarMaxAdopt)` KES (Equation \ref{eq:cStarAdopt}), and the corresponding adoption rate of $\mathcal{A} =$ `r round(100 * adoptRateTotal, 1)`% (Equation \ref{eq:AdoptRate}). The aggregate net subsidy required from the Ministry of Agriculture to achieve this rate follows from Equation \ref{eq:aggSubsidy} as `r round(aggSubsidy, 2)` billion KES. The corresponding increase in expected aggregate supply and producer welfare follow from Equations \ref{eq:dEQT0} and \ref{eq:dEPsi} as `r round(dQ, 2)` 1000 MT and `r round(dPsi, 2)` billion KES, respectively (assuming normal rainfall $\tilde{k}_r^{\kappa_r} = 1$). The breakdown by stratum is given in the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:intervention}, accompanied by a graphic of the corresponding supply ribbon shift in the right panel.
<!-- By the criterion in Inequality \ref{eq:adoptCondSimp}, adoption in the absence of exogenous subsidies/costs will increase farm net benefit only if the the percentage increase in TFP $\partial \ln(g) =$ `r 100 * dlng0`% is greater than the absolute value of the percentage decrease in output price plus the $\alpha_i$-scaled increase in input prices (i.e. only if $\partial \ln(g) > |\partial \ln(\nu)|$).  -->

For policy formation, it is helpful to consider interventions in a sensitivity heatmap format whereby multiple farm subsidy and price change scenarios can be examined at a single glance (Figure \ref{fig:decisionMaps}). By illustrating the impact of changes in subsidy and assumed price shifts in a readily digestible manner, these maps build intuition about the effectiveness of changes in subsidy policy and the implications of price changes associated with the intervention.

The illustrative example presented above is an exercise in comparative statics. That is to say, it is a comparison of the "before new tech" (or status quo) and "after new tech" situations, without accounting for the time it takes for release and adoption to occur. In a standard impact assessment, the static analysis would be converted into a temporally explicit assessment by introducing a sigmoidal adoption rate curve over time, as explained in Alston et al. [] and elsewhere. The welfare impact would be then be calculated as the sum of discounted yearly net impacts out to a relevant cutoff year determined by the policy question.

# Discussion and conclusion

A model of agricultural supply and of the production side impact of new technology (or any exogenous shock) is useful to agricultural policy makers insofar as it can map out the plausible outcome space for the relevant range of price assumptions and policy lever settings (subsidies) underpinning the policy discussion; and insofar as this mapping is transparently rooted in an empirically vetted, sensible theoretical foundation.

More specifically, this means that a useful model of aggregate supply must explicitly account for 1) the shape of the yield distribution, and hence also provide an endogenous accounting of farm entry and exit in response to price changes; 2) the endogenous farm level supply response to new technology (or any exogenous shock) and to any associated exogenous changes in input/output prices and subsidies; and 3) the aggregation of farm level response and welfare impacts up to the population level---i.e. the supply curve shift---in a theoretically sensible and transparent way, including endogenous modeling of the adoption rate.

As mentioned in the Introduction, the conventional approach to modeling aggregate agricultural supply and technology shocks provides no such explicit, theoretically grounded, endogenous accounting. Instead, the shape of the distribution is unceremoniously ignored (or identically endowed marginal firms are assumed), the supply response and adoption rate are assumed as exogenous inputs into the model, essentially synonymous with the technology shock itself; and the aggregation of farm level impacts up to the population level is neither empirically nor theoretically grounded, but rather introduced as a matter of fiat. As a result, the model is ill suited to answer such basic policy questions such as:

*By how much will the adoption rate/producer welfare/aggregate supply change if the change in TFP turns out to be $10$% higher or lower than expected?

*By how much will the adoption rate/producer welfare/aggregate supply change if subsidies are increased/lowered?

*By how much will the adoption rate/producer welfare/aggregate supply change if the change in input prices is $10$%?

*Given a certain change in TFP and input/output prices, what subsidy level is required to push adoption over $50$%?

To more squarely meet the needs of agricultural policy makers, here an alternative modeling framework is theoretically derived from 5 non-controversial axioms, and empirically vetted against Kenya farm data. The proposed model can answer the ussual policy questions such as those just enumerated, as well as many others not often considered part of the purview of such models. In particular, the model explicitly controls for meteorological conditions and price volatility, and disaggregates results by binary endowment stratum. The model can thus be used to examine highly nuanced scenarios regarding technology packages tailored to specific farming systems under different weather and price volatility settings.

For example, on untenured farms, the technology package could be bundled with legal services to formalize a title deed, such that TFP on such farms is augmented not just by the new techology coefficient ($\beta_{new}$), but also by the tenure coefficient $\beta_{new} + \beta_{tenure}$. (In such a scenario, the cost of the legal services would be included in the $\partial B$ term.) If the technology shock is a new seed variety, then the impact on farms growing hybrid maize will be considerably less than on non-hybrid farms, as TFP is augmented not by $\beta_{new}$ but by $\beta_{new} - \beta_{hybrid}$.

The proposed model is highly adaptive to the data that is available. The Kenya example explored above represents an ideal case where good farm survey data is available. Under less auspicious circumstances, model parameters can still be estimated up to a respectable degree of precision because the model is expressed in terms of economic indicators and population parameters (the farm employment rate, PEFS-adjusted probability of profit, observed mean and standard deviation of yield and expenditure) that in many cases is published or readily deductible from available information. As explained in section \ref{sec:acct4Stoch}, model parameters can also be estimated based on price information.
<!-- The conventional approach, by contrast, makes no use of farm survey data even when it is available. Rather, the model parameters are mostly elicited from "experts"---i.e., scientists directly involved in the research who have a vested interest in the impact assessment---makes very little use of farm survey data even when it is available. -->

<!-- compare numbers of parameters? -->
<!-- \ref{sec:aggImpact} -->

The model developed here is limited to the evaluation of aggregate supply and production side impacts. The model can be expanded to include aggregate demand and consumer side impacts (i.e. a full fledged partial equilibrium model) by pairing the derivation above with a theoretical derivation of the demand curve from the same set of axioms. While this lies outside the scope of the present effort, one may reasonably anticipate that this will involve reinterpretation of the input demand curve derived in section \ref{sec:axioms1and2} as a processing plant (e.g. miller, starch factory) feedstock demand curve; and the aggregation of this curve over the processor plant population density. In the Kenya maize example above (and many other such applied cases), the number of processors is small relative to the number of producers, such that the resulting aggregate demand curve would likely represent a monopsony or cartel demand curve, especially at subnational scales of analysis.

By explicitly including aggregate demand in the modeling, the equilibrium output price becomes endogenous to the model, and consumer welfare can be evaluated. (Although it should be kept in mind that "consumer welfare" in such instances is, more accurately, processing plant welfare; and thus does not necessarily reflect the welfare that ultimately passes through to the end consumer.) In the Kenya maize example above, producer welfare alone is not enough to offset the total subsidy paid out by the government to encourage adoption. Adding in consumer welfare would likely result in a net positive return on the government's investment.

In future work, it will be interesting to use this model to examine the role of price volatility and price support (forward contracts, price floors) on technology adoption and impact under different meteorological scenarios.  and to test the limits of the model in minimum data contexts.

It may also be interesting to model technology shocks as a perturbation of the degree of homogeneity ($h$). Preliminary exploration of the matter suggests that the supply response to and welfare outcomes of changes in homogeneity are considerably more complex and ambiguous than they are in the case of changes to TFP.

future work: consumer side impact, price guarantees, forward contracts, can also look at shocks to continuous endowments k; map between employment rate and PEFS adj mean prob of profit
another way is to shock h, much more ambiguous results.

## Price and cross price elsaticities of input demand

Decreasing returns to scale imply strictly downward sloping input demand curves. To see this, consider the derivative of input demand (Equation \ref{eq:inputDem1}) with respect to input own price.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \ln(x^*_i)}{\partial \ln(w_i)} = \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(w_i)} - 1 \end{equation}

To resolve the yield derivative, note that a more conventional textbook form of $y^*$ can be written by combining Equations \ref{eq:cobbDoug2} and \ref{eq:inputDem1}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
y^* &= y|_{x_i = x^*_i} = g \prod_{i = 1}^{n_k} k_i^{\kappa_i} \prod_{i = 1}^{n_x} x^*_i^{\alpha_i} \\
&= g \prod_{i = 1}^{n_k} k_i^{\kappa_i} \prod_{i = 1}^{n_x} \left( \frac{y^* P \alpha_i}{\lambda w_i} \right)^{\alpha_i}
&\rightarrow y^* = \left( g \prod_{i = 1}^{n_k} k_i^{\kappa_i} \prod_{i = 1}^{n_x} \frac{\alpha_i}{w_i} \right)^{1 / (1 - h)} \left( \frac{P}{\lambda} \right)^{h / (1 - h)}
\end{split}
\label{eq:yStarAlt}
\end{equation}

Hence the yield derivative with respect to input price works out to

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(w_i)} &= -\frac{\alpha_i}{1 - h}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

And so the input own and cross price elasticity resolve, respectively,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \ln(x^*_i)}{\partial \ln(w_i)} = -\frac{\alpha_i}{1 - h} - 1 < 0
\end{equation}

And

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \ln(x_i^*)}{\partial \ln(w_{j \neq i})} = -\frac{\alpha_j}{1 - h} < 0
\label{eq:CrossPriceElas}
\end{equation}

whereby it is clear that the domain of $h$ implies negatively sloped own and cross price demand curves. It follows, moreover, that input own price elasticity of demand is strictly less than or equal to unity. Input cross price elasticity of demand is elastic if $h \in (1 - \alpha_j, 1)$, inelastic if $h \in (0, 1 - \alpha_j)$, and linear if $h = 1 - \alpha_j$. Note that increasing returns to scale would imply strictly upward sloping cross price demand curves, and the possibility of upward sloping own price demand curves.

A.2

## Differentiation of expenditure TFP, yield, and expenditure with respect to TFP

The derivative of expenditure TFP ($v$) with respect to TFP ($g$) follows from Equations \ref{eq:v0forms}.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \ln(v)}{\partial \ln(g)} = 1 - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \ln(g)}
\end{equation}

And the derivatives $\partial \ln (C^*) / \partial \ln(g)$ and $\partial \ln(y^*) / \partial \ln(g)$ then follow from the expressions in Equation \ref{eq:fnCsharp}.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \ln(C^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} &= \frac{1}{1 - h} \left( \frac{\partial \ln(v)}{\partial \ln(g)} + \frac{\partial \ln(C^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} \right)  \\
&\rightarrow \frac{\partial \ln(C^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} = \frac{1}{1 - h} \left( 1 - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \ln(g)} + \frac{\partial \ln(P)}{\partial \ln(g)} \right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

And

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} &= \frac{\partial \ln(v)}{\partial \ln(g)} - h \frac{\partial \ln(C^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} \\
&= \frac{1}{1 - h} \left( 1 - \boldsymbol{\alpha} ' \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \ln(g)} + h \frac{\partial \ln(P)}{\partial \ln(g)} \right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

<!-- \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial B} = \lambda -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- <!-- The budget shadow price is an implicit measure of how each farm values cash for expenditures on farm inputs, and plays a central role in the aggregation step farther below. -->

<!-- A.2 -->
<!-- ## Returns to scale and price elasticity of the farm yield envelope \label{sec:A2} -->

<!-- The second order conditions examined above (Equation \ref{eq:eqSOC}) imply that constant returns to scale ($h = 1$) occur at the breakeven point of zero net benefit; and that increasing returns to scale ($h > 1$) minimize net benefit. The only values of $h$ over which the second order condition for maximum net benefit are met are $0 < h < 1$. Therefore, axioms 1 and 2 lead to the corollary that optimal farm yield exhibits strictly decreasing returns to scale. Note that it also follows that the farm yield function is globally concave in inputs only for decreasing returns to scale. Constant and increasing returns, on the other hand, would imply global linearity and convexity, respectively. -->

<!-- Turning to output supply and input demand curves, note that the derivative of logged optimal yield (Equation \ref{eq:YdEnvNeat}) with respect to output price is -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial P} = h \frac{\partial \ln(C^*)}{\partial P} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Recalling that $C^* = R^* h / \lambda$ (Equation \ref{eq:cStar}), the output price elasticity of farm supply resolves as follows. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \begin{split} -->
<!-- \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial P} &= h \left( \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial P} + \frac{1}{P} \right) \\ -->
<!-- \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial P} &= \frac{h}{1 - h} \frac{1}{P} \\ -->
<!-- \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(P)} &= \frac{h}{1 - h} -->
<!-- \end{split} -->
<!-- \label{eq:PelastYstar} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Because returns to scale are strictly decreasing, it follows that farm supply is positively sloped. Moreover, farm supply is elastic for $h \in (1 / 2 , 1)$, inelastic for $h \in (0, 1 / 2)$, and linear when $h = 1 / 2$. Note that increasing returns to scale would imply negatively sloped supply curves. -->

<!-- ## Marginal cost -->
<!-- <!-- ### Marginal cost and unit cost -->
<!-- <!-- Some important/underrepresented corollaries -->
<!-- <!-- Because the C-D fn has fallen into such disrepute, it is worthwhile to take a moment to highlight some attractive corollaries that are underrepresented in the textbook treatments. [and one new one -lipton] -->

<!-- From Equation \ref{eq:YdEnvNeat}, it follows that -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \frac{d \ln(y^*)}{d \ln(C^*)} = h -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- In words, the degree of homogeneity $h$ may also be interpreted as the "scale elasticity of yield"---the fraction by which yield increases given a unit increase in expenditure. (This is a standard result for the Cobb-Douglas form, usually noted in the textbooks [@heathfield1987introduction]). -->
<!-- The farm marginal cost follows from this as -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \frac{dC^*}{dy^*} = \frac{C^*}{y^* h} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Which, considering Equation \ref{eq:cStar}, may also be written -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \frac{dC^*}{dy^*} = \frac{P}{\lambda} -->
<!-- \label{eq:margCost} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Axioms 1 and 2 thus imply that marginal cost is proportionate, but not equal, to output price. If they were equal, then this would constitute theoretical grounds upon which to presume that every farm has the same marginal cost. And then from there it would be a short jump to presume, as is often done, that a given exogenous shock affects every farm's marginal cost identically. But no, marginal cost varies with $\lambda$. In highly developed economic sectors, it may be that $\lambda$ is effectively determined by the lending rate, and is thus homogeneous across firms; but this is generally not true in the primary sector. In the primary sector, heterogeneous endowments result in heterogeneous valuation of marginal increments in production expenditure (i.e. $\lambda$). -->
<!-- <!-- This may be considered one of the hallmarks of the primary sector setting it apart from other sectors. -->

<!-- The relation between marginal cost and "average cost" (i.e. optimal unit cost) readily follows from Equation \ref{eq:margCost}. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \frac{dC^*}{dy^*} = \frac{C^{\#}}{h} \:\:; \:\:\: C^{\#} = C^*/y^* -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- The standard assertion that profit-maximizing farms produce such that marginal cost equals average cost thus implies constant returns to scale ($h = 1$), which in turn implies a marginal farm producing for zero profit with a perfectly inelastic farm supply curve that is globally linear in inputs. -->
<!-- Since $P = d R^* / d y^*$, this can be rearranged into another instructive expression for $\lambda$. -->
<!-- constant marginal cost. (As mentioned in the introduction, this is well supported empirically [].) -->

<!-- \frac{C^*_i}{C^*} = \frac{\alpha_i}{h} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->
<!-- This instructive corollary of axioms 1 and 2 says that optimal expenditure shares are equal to their respective technology shares.

A.3
## Proof of Equation \ref{eq:keyResult}

For any lognormally distributed $\chi$, the probability density function $\rho(\chi)$ is defined

\begin{equation}
\rho(\chi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} s_{\chi}} e^{-\frac{(\ln(\chi) - m_{\chi})^2}{2 s^2_{\chi}}} \:\:;\:\:\: m_{\chi} = E[\ln(\chi)] \:\:\: s^2_{\chi} = Var[\ln(\chi)]
\end{equation}

So for a given constant upper bound $\chi \leq \xi$,

\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{\xi} \chi \rho(\chi) \: d\chi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} s_{\chi}} \int_{0}^{P} \chi e^{-\frac{(\ln(\chi) - m_{\chi})^2}{2 s^2_{\chi}}} d \ln(\chi)
\label{eq:proofStep1}
\end{equation}

Introducing a change of variables,

\begin{equation}
\gamma = \frac{\ln(\chi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}} \: \rightarrow \: d \ln(\chi) = s_{\chi} d \gamma
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:proofStep1} resolves as follows.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\int_{0}^{\xi} \chi \rho(\chi) \: d\chi &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}}} e^{(\gamma s_{\chi} + m_{\chi}) } e^{-\frac{\gamma^2}{2}} d \gamma \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}}} e^{-1/2[\gamma^2 - 2 \gamma s_{\chi}  - 2 m_{\chi} ]} d \gamma
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where the argument of the exponential function resolves as follows,

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
-1/2[\gamma^2 - 2 m_{\chi}  - 2 \gamma s_{\chi} ]\end{split} \\
&= -1/2 [(\gamma - s_{\chi} )^2 - 2 m_{\chi}  - s^2_{\chi} ^2 ] \\
&= -\frac{(\gamma - s_{\chi} )^2}{2} + m_{\chi}  + \frac{s^2_{\chi}}{2} ^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}

So the integral can be rewritten

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}}} e^{-\frac{(\gamma - s_{\chi} )^2}{2} + m_{\chi}  + \frac{s^2_{\chi}}{2} ^2} d \gamma \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{m_{\chi}  + \frac{s^2_{\chi}}{2} ^2} \int_{0}^{\frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}}} e^{-\frac{(\gamma - s_{\chi} )^2}{2}} d \gamma \\
&= \frac{E[\chi]}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{0}^{\frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}}} e^{-\frac{(\gamma - s_{\chi} )^2}{2}} d \gamma \\
&= E[\chi] \Phi \left(\frac{\ln(\xi) - m_{\chi}}{s_{\chi}} - s_{\chi}  \right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $\Phi()$ is the standard normal cumulative distribtion function.

\begin{equation}
\Phi(\ell) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{0}^{\ell} e^{-\frac{\psi^2}{2}} d \psi
\end{equation}

# Proof that optimal unit cost is a geometric brownian motion with the same parameters as price

If $P(t)$ is a gBm with drift and volatility parameters $m_p$ and $s_p$, and given the relation (Equation \ref{eq:useful3}),

$$
C^{\#}(t) = P(t) \frac{h}{\lambda}
$$

Then Ito's Lemma states

\begin{equation}
\Delta C^{\#} = \left(\frac{\partial C^{\#}}{\partial t} + m_p P(t) \frac{\partial C^{\#}}{\partial P} +  \frac{1}{2} s_p^2 P(t)^2 \frac{\partial^2 C^{\#}}{\partial P^2}  \right) \Delta t + s_p P(t) \partial C^{\#}}{\partial P} \epsilon \sqrt{\Delta t}
\label{eq:itoLem}
\end{equation}

Where $\epsilon$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$. (For a reference see Hull [-@hull9thEdition].)

By Equation \ref{eq:useful3},

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C^{\#}}{\partial t} = 0 \:\:\:\: \frac{\partial C^{\#}}{\partial P} = \frac{C^{\#}}{P} \:\:\:\: \frac{\partial^2 C^{\#}}{\partial P^2} = 0
\end{equation}

Such that Equation \ref{eq:itoLem} resolves to

\begin{equation}
\Delta C^{\#} = m_p C^{\#} \Delta t + s_p C^{\#} \epsilon \sqrt{\Delta t}
\end{equation}

By which it follows that $C^{\#}$ has the same drift and volatility parameters as $P(t)$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[C^{\#} / C^{\#}] &= m_p \Delta t \\
Var[C^{\#}(T)] &= s^2_p \Delta t
\end{split}
\end{equation}

And thus

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E[\ln(C^{\#}(T))]\bigr|_{t = 0} &= \ln(C^{\#}(0)) + \left(m_p - \frac{s^2_p}{2} \right) T \\
Var[\ln(C^{\#}(T))]\bigr|_{t = 0} &= s^2_p T
\end{split}
\end{equation}

# Appendix B: Data details and preparation

The raw Kenya farm data files used in this article are open access and available from Tegemeo Institute upon request. The files detail short and long rains maize production (and that of any other crops grown), farm size, input (seed, synthetic and organic fertilizer, chemical pest control) use and cost, land tenure type, and land preparation type and cost, for the years 1997, 2000, 2004, 2007, and 2010. For the present article, only the 2007 long rains (i.e. main season) data is used. Data on production, area, seed, fertilizer, land preparation, and tenure are provided at field level. Fields where maize is not grown or is not the main crop are dropped. Green and dry maize production are reported separately. Green maize production is converted to dry maize equivalent by subtracting 15% of the production weight. The field level input and production files are then merged and aggregated up to farm level. Farm yield is then calculated as maize production (kg.) divided by maize area (acres). Chemical input use and cost are reported at farm level, indicating the main crop on the farm to which the input is applied. Chemical pest controls are counted as costs only if applied primarily to maize. Synthetic fertilizer consists of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN), nitrogen phosphorus potassium (NPK), Urea, and diammonium phosphate (DAP). Different mixtures under these headings (e.g. NPK 22:11:11, NPK 18:12:12, NPK 17:17:0, etc.) are aggregated. Farm level cost is then calculated as the sum of seed, fertilizer, chemical pest control, and land preparation costs in Kenyan Shillings per acre (KES/acre).
<!-- This is then merged with the main farm level file.  -->

Land preparation type (manual, oxen, tractor, or none) and land tenure type (owned by parent/relative, owned with title deed, owned without title deed, rented) are reported at field level. Dummy variables are created for land preparation types "oxen" and "tractor", and for the land tenure type "owned with title deed". When aggregating to farm level, the land preparation dummies are preserved if present on any field.

The field level data files also include details on seed type and method of acquisition. For this article, farms are considered adopters of hybrid maize seed if they use either purchased hybrid seed or a mixture of retained and purchased hybrid maize seed on any of their fields.

Main season rainfall is reported in millimeters at district level. (Prior to the 2010 constitution, counties were referred to as "districts".) The "rain anomaly" variable appearing in the regression is calculated as 2007 main season rainfall divided by 1997 main season rainfall. Rain anomaly values greater or less than $1$ thus indicate departures north or south of the 1997 benchmark.
<!--main07 This file, originally generated by Tavneet Suri, contains 2007 and historic average main season rainfall reported by the FEWS National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center, georeferenced to the 2007 TAMPA/TAPRA survey. -->

# Appendix C: Derivation of the technology adoption condition in Equation \ref{eq:adoptCond}

The farm profit lagrangian in Equation \ref{eq:lagrangian} evaluated at $y^*$ gives the farm profit envelope.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}^* = R^* + \lambda (B - C^*)
\end{equation}

By Equation \ref{eq:cStar}, this reduces to

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}^* = R^* (1 - h) + \lambda B
\end{equation}

Assuming that farms will adopt a new yield scaling technology only if they expect it to increase their net benefit, the adoption condition is $\partial \mathcal{L}^*/\partial \ln(g) > 0$. That is,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \ln(g)} = E[R^*(T)]|_{t = 0} (1 - h) \left( \frac{\partial \ln(P)}{\partial u} + \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial u} \right) + \lambda \frac{\partial B}{\partial u} > 0
\end{equation}

The yield derivative resolves by substituting $P y^* h/\lambda$ for $C^*$ in Equation \ref{eq:YdEnvNeat0} and differentiating with repect to $\ln(g)$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} &= 1 - \mathbf{\alpha} {'} \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \ln(g)} + h \frac{\partial \ln(P)}{\partial \ln(g)} + h \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} \\
&\rightarrow \frac{\partial \ln(y^*)}{\partial \ln(g)} = \frac{1}{1 - h} \left( 1 - \mathbf{\alpha} {'} \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial \ln(g)} + \frac{\partial \ln(P)}{\partial \ln(g)} \right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Substituting this into the adoption condition and simplifying,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \ln(g)} = \frac{1 - \mathbf{\alpha} {'} \frac{\partial \ln(\mathbf{w})}{\partial u}} + \partial \ln(P)}{\partial \ln(g)} \right) + \frac{\lambda}{R^*} \frac{\partial B}{\partial u} > 0
\end{equation}

Which further reduces to

\begin{equation}
\partial \ln(P) - \mathbf{\alpha} {'} \partial \ln(\mathbf{w}) + \partial \ln(g)  + \frac{\lambda}{R^*} \partial B > 0
\end{equation}

Or, substituting $h / C^*$ for $\lambda / R^*$,

\begin{equation}
\partial \ln(P) - \mathbf{\alpha} {'} \partial \ln(\mathbf{w}) + \partial \ln(g)  + \frac{h}{C^*} \partial B > 0
\end{equation}

And, in stochastic terms,

\begin{equation}
\partial \ln(E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}) - \mathbf{\alpha} {'} \partial \ln(\mathbf{w}) + \partial \ln(g)  + \frac{h}{C^*} \partial B > 0
\end{equation}

Note, first of all, that the yield envelope is undefined at $h = 1$. The theory constructed so far from Axioms 1 and 2 thus contradicts the deeply entrenched surmise among economists, going back at least to Hicks [-@hicks1963theory], and later cemented into place by Solow [-@solow1957technical], that yield functions are homogeneous of degree 1. -->

<!-- In section \ref{sec:PDfunP}, circumstances are explored under which increasing returns to scale are possible. However, these circumstances generally apply to firms---mills and factories, for example---and not to farms. -->

<!-- The domain of $h$ derived above in turn implies the following bounds on the price elasticity of yield. -->
<!-- <!-- Note, in passing, that the input price elasticity of yield likewise bears the expected sign only under decreasing returns to scale. -->

<!-- ## Input demand \label{sec:inDem} -->

<!-- Using equation \ref{eq:YdEnvCompact} to substitute for $y^*$ in input demand (equation \ref{eq:inputDem1}) gives the following expression for input demand as a function of basal yield, prices, input elasticities, the budget shadow price, and control variables together with their respective elasticities. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- x_v^* = \frac{\alpha_v}{w_v} \left( y_0 \frac{P \theta_x \theta_k}{\lambda \theta_w} \right)^{\frac{1}{1 - h}} -->

<!-- Here another Axiom comes into play. -->

<!-- \begin{framed} -->
<!--    \textbf{Axiom 4} \\ Demand curves are negatively sloped. $\left( \frac{\partial \ln(x_v^*)}{\partial \ln(w_v)} < 0 \:\: \forall v \right)$ -->
<!-- \end{framed} -->

<!-- From equation \ref{eq:ownPriceElas}, it is clear that Axiom 4 imposes the following domain on $h$. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- h \in (-\infty, 1 + \underline{\alpha}) \:\:; \:\:\: \underline{\alpha} = \min(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Considering that $\underline{\alpha} > 0$, the effective domain of $h$ satisfying both Axioms 3 and 4 (upward sloping supply curves and downward sloping demand curves) is -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- h \in (0, 1) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- The effective domain of $h$ in turn implies the following bounds on the own price elasticity of input demand. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \frac{\partial \ln(x_v^*)}{\partial \ln(w_v)} \in (\infty, -1) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- The input demand curve is thus always elastic, such that the increase in farm level demand resulting from a decrease in the input price is always more than proportionate to the fall in price. -->

<!-- Note that the cross price elasticity of input demand also bears the expected sign under the effective domain of $h$, -->


<!-- As does the output price elasticity of input demand, -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \frac{\partial \ln(x_v^*)}{\partial \ln(P)} = \frac{1}{1 - h} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Equation \ref{eq:inputDem2} implies that the input demand curve^["Input demand curve" is used as a shorthand for the "optimal input level as a function of its price, with all other variables held constant".] is a power law.

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- x_v^* = z w_v^{\eta(w_v, x_v^*)} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Where -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- z = \left(y_0 \frac{\theta_x \theta_k}{\lambda^h \tilde{\theta}_w} \right)^{\frac{1}{1 - h}} \:\:;\:\:\: \tilde{\theta}_w = w_v^{-\alpha_v}\theta_w -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- And $\eta(w_v, x_v^*)$ is the own price elasticity of input demand, derived in equation \ref{eq:ownPriceElas}. -->

<!-- In equation \ref{eq:cobbDoug2}, the shorthand $y_0 = e^{\alpha_0}$ has also been introduced. The scale factor $y_0$ is the yield when inputs $\mathbf{x}$ are set to 1 and the control variables $\mathbf{k}$ are also set to 1. It may thus be interpreted as the "unit input yield" or "unit input ceteris paribus yield", to be more precise. "Basal yield" is henceforth used as a shorthand. -->
<!-- Many economists prefer to call $y_0$ the "total factor productivity" (TFP). This is because $y_0$ equals, in some sense, the "yield per unit all inputs" when it is isolated on one side of the equation. However, the presence of control variables complicates this interpretation. Moreover, TFP implies bizarre and rather useless units of measurement. For example, if the inputs $x_i$ are labor and pesticide, while the control variables $k_i$ are rainfall, temperature, and farmer age, then the TFP $y_0$ has units of kg hectare$^{-1}$ manhour$^{-1}$ liter$^{-1}$ millimeter$^{-1}$ degree Celsius$^{-1}$ years$^{-1}$, each of which is raised to various exponents (the respective elasticities $\alpha_i$ and $\kappa_i$). Because of the exponents, a more accurate name for TFP would be the "technology adjusted total factor productivity". -->
<!-- Nonetheless, a very mature literature has developed around TFP, and the reader is encouraged to continue thinking of $y_0$ in terms of TFP if that is what they are most comfortable with. The "basal yield" interpretation is merely provided here as an alternative for those of us who wrestle with the idea of TFP or are not yet familiar with it. -->
<!-- exogenously given control variables like age, soil quality, or climate variables. -->
<!-- TFP vis-à-vis dimensional analysis -->
<!-- The (in)famous residual -->
<!-- “The rate of growth of total factor productivity is defined as the difference between the rate of growth of real product and the rate of growth of real factor input” (Jorgenson & Griliches, 1967). This definition violates dimensional analysis. -->

<!-- "TFP"=K=y/(x_1^(α_1 ) x_2^(α_2 )…x_n^(α_n ) )	(2) -->
<!-- There are two problems with this expression from the point of view of dimensional analysis. First of all, the units in which “TFP” is expressed are impossible to make sense of. Say n=4, with x_1 standing for labor, x_2 for machinery, x_3 for fertilizer, and x_4 for pesticide. Then TFP has units of production per unit -->
<!-- area (man hour)^(α_1 ) (machine hour)^(α_2 )  (weight)^(α_3 )  (volume)^(α_4 )	(3) -->
<!-- The second, more serious, problem is that these units will always vary from one data set to another. Even if the variables x_1,x_2,…,x_n are the same across studies, and are expressed in the same units, the units in which the “residual” K is expressed will nonetheless vary because the estimated parameters α_i vary. It is therefore impossible to make meaningful comparisons of K across data sets. -->
<!-- On the other hand, it is possible to make meaningful comparisons of the residual in another sense. Define the parameter K as follows: -->
<!-- K=k/(x ̃_1^(α_1 ) x ̃_2^(α_2 )…x ̃_n^(α_n ) )	(3) -->
<!-- Where the x ̃_i are arbitrarily chosen reference values. Then the yield equation becomes: -->
<!-- y=ku_1^(α_1 ) u_2^(α_2 )… u_n^(α_n )  ;  u_i=x_i/x ̃_i 	(3) -->
<!-- It now becomes clear what the units of k are. Each x ̃_i has the same units as its respective x_i. This means that all of the u_i^(α_i ) terms on the right hand side of the equation are dimensionless. Therefore, the units of k must agree with the units of whatever is on the left hand side, which happens to be yield.  -->
<!-- k=y/(u_1^(α_1 ) u_2^(α_2 )… u_n^(α_n ) )	(5) -->
<!-- When interpreted in this way, it is now possible to make meaningful comparisons of the residual across data sets (if the reference values x ̃_i are harmonized across the data sets). However, the residual now has units of productivity with respect to land only, and not with respect to any other factor, much less the “total factor”. -->
<!-- Conclusion -->
<!-- Above I have shown that TFP (equation 2) is measured in units which 1) are virtually impossible to make sense of, and 2) cannot be compared across data sets. I have shown that it is possible to express the residual in straightforward units that are comparable across data sets, but that these are units of land productivity only. The residual may be interpreted as TFP only at the cost of nonsensical units and cross-study incompatibility. A residual with sensible units and comparability, on the other hand, comes at the cost of expressibility only in units of a single factor’s productivity—land in the case of farms, widget factories in the case of firms. -->
<!-- As mentioned above, this result depends on a definition of small increase as a marginal increase. Other forms result from other definitions of small increase. If small increase is defined as a percentage increase, for example, a functional form involving Lambert's W function results (left as an exercise for the reader). The Cobb-Douglas function is selected from among these two choices on empirical grounds. (The Cobb-Douglas function is famous for how well it fits economic data across many contexts and scales.) -->

<!-- ## The farm net benefit envelope -->

<!-- The optimized objective function or "net benefit envelope" $\mathcal{L}^*$ is just the objective function $\mathcal{L}$ evaluated at the optimal yield $y^*$. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \mathcal{L}^* = \mathcal{L} \bigr|_{y = y^*} = P y^* - \lambda (C^* - B) -->

<!-- Note that, applying the handy relation in equation \ref{eq:lambdaHandy}, the net benefit envelope can be rewritten without the optimal expenditure term $C^*$. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \mathcal{L}^* = (1 - h) P y^* + \lambda B -->
<!-- \label{eq:NBenv} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Farm production $q^*$ is, of course, just farm yield envelope times farm area. Often, area is one of the control variables in $\theta_k$. In this case, $q^*$ is given by adding $1$ to the fitted exponent (call this $\kappa_a$) on area. -->

<!-- The term $1 - \Phi(z)$ may thus be interpreted as the probability, at planting time, that the elasticity adjusted output price at time of harvest and sale $P(T)^{\eta(P)}$ will be greater than the corresponding elasticity adjusted mean marginal cost of production $\mu_{C^{\#}}(T)^{\eta(D)}$. -->

To see this, it may be helpful to rewrite the condition in terms of a "marginal benefit-cost" ratio $r$. -->

<!-- The exogenous shock is introduced as a change in farm yield and cost elicited from experimental trial results and from scientists with a clear conflict of interest. These results must then be adjusted to reflect economic yield as opposed to experimental yield, but no clear method of adjustment is available because, in the name of expedience, the aggregate curve is not built up from the farm level curve, and so no farm level yield function is ever specified in the process. The change in yield in cost must be calculated from the economic yield and cost envelopes evaluated at the new technology, not the other way around.

<!-- ## Derivation of a provisional aggregate supply function from the forgoing + axioms 3 and 4 -->

<!-- The contours of an aggregate supply function begin to emerge into view when one considers what might happen if one of the farm production expressions above is substituted for $q^*$ in Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0}. In particular, it becomes clear that: -->

<!-- 1) Insofar as prices are constant across the population, and insofar as $y_0$ and the technology $\alpha_i$ are estimated on farm survey data (and are thus constant across the farm population), then $y_0$, $P$, $h$, $\theta_x$, and $\theta_w$ are constants that factor out of the integral. -->

<!-- 2) Control variables, and thus $\hat{\theta}_k$, inevitably vary across the population. But if production is lognormally distributed (axiom 3), then it follows that $\hat{\theta}_k$ is independent of either $\lambda$ or $C^{\#}$, such that the population mean of $\hat{\theta}_k$ factors out of the integral. -->

<!-- 3) It follows from (1) and (2), and from the law of the unconscious statistician, that the integral with respect to $q^*$ reduces to an integral with respect to $\lambda$, $C^{\#}$, or $C^*$, depending upon which of the expressions for farm production is used. In the case of Equation \ref{eq:prodFn2}, e.g., Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0} can now be rewritten as follows. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- Q = N \left(y_0 \frac{\theta_x}{\theta_w} \right)^{\eta + 1} E \left[\theta_k^{\eta + 1} \right] h^{-\eta} \int_{\underline{C}^{\#}}^{\overline{C}^{\#}} C^{\# \eta} f \left(C^{\#} \right) \: dC^{\#} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Where the farm density $\rho()$ that appears in Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0} has been rewritten in terms of the probability density $f()$ and the number of farms in the population $N$ (i.e., $\rho(C^{\#}) = N f(C^{\#})$). -->

<!-- 4) Assuming that farms enter production only if they expect to make a profit (axiom 4), then unit cost cannot exceed output price, thus resolving the upper bound of this integral. Since cost cannot be negative, the lower bound is $0$. The domain of integration must then be $0 < C^{\#} < P$. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- Q &= N E[k_a] E[y^*] \frac{1}{E[C^{\# \eta}]} \int_{0}^{P} C^{\# \eta} f(C^{\#}) \: dC^{\#} -->

<!-- \int_{0}^{P} C^{\# \eta} f(C^{\#}) \: dC^{\#} = E[C^{\# \eta}] \Phi \left(\frac{\ln \left( \frac{E[C^{\# \eta}]}{P} \right) + \frac{s_{\#}^2}{2}}{s_{\#}} \right) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Such that the aggregate supply equation reduces to -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- Q &= N E[k_a] E[y^*] \Phi \left(\frac{\ln \left( \frac{E[C^{\# \eta}]}{P} \right) + \frac{s_{\#}^2}{2}}{\eta s_{\#}} \right) \:;\:\:\: s_{\#}^2 = Var[\ln(C^{\#})] -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- This might be a suitable aggregate supply function in sectors characterized by highly deterministic production processes, negligible delays between input decisions and output, and negligible output price volatility. However, it is not suited to the primary sector, where production is partly deterministic, partly a function of stochastic meteorological variables; where there is a significant delay between input decisions and output (i.e., the cropping season); and where output price volatility looms large in any management decision. In order to accommodate these features, a suitable assumption regarding the stochastic character of output price (axiom 5) is introduced in the next section; and the aggregate supply model derived above is modified accordingly. In addition to accommodating the stochastic character of farm production, the modified model resolves the term $\Phi(\gamma)$ into a surprisingly instructive and intuitive form. -->

<!-- Where $\omega^2 = Var[\ln(v)]$ and $\Phi()$ is the standard cumulative normal distribution function. (See Appendix A2 for proof.) -->

<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- \end{split} -->
<!-- \label{eq:aggSup02a} -->

<!-- <!-- This is an aggregate supply curve that explicitly accounts for input prices, farm size, technology, and control variables ($\hat{\theta}$), as well as for output price and farm entry/exit in response to changes in output price.

<!--  it is useful to express $y^*$ in terms of optimal cost per unit output or "average cost", henceforth referred to as the optimal unit cost or unit expenditure. Denoting this $C^{\#}$, then by definition, -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- C^{\#} = \frac{C^*}{y^*} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Substituting $C^{\#} y^*$ for $C^*$ in Equation \ref{eq:YdEnvNeat} and solving for $y^*$ gives -->

<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Taking the expectation and rearranging gives  -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- E[k]^{\eta + 1} E[C^{\# h}]^{\eta + 1} = E[k^{\eta + 1}] E[C^{\# \eta}] -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Such that the previous expression simplifies to -->

<!-- \label{eq:YdEnvNeatSharp} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- While this is a poor choice of econometric yield model (because unit cost is calculated as a function of yield, and would thus introduce an endogeneity problem if used in an OLS regression), it facilitates the derivation of the aggregate supply function because $C^{\#}$ has a clear upper bound of integration stipulated by axiom 3. Recall that axiom 3 states that farms enter production only if they expect to make non-negative profit. Mathematically, this means $C^* \leq R^*$---an inequality that is ill suited to definite integration since $R^*$ varies across the population. But the inequality simplifies to $C^{\#} \leq P$, which is useful for definite integration since the upper bound $P$ is constant across the population.  -->

<!-- Returning to the main task at hand, farm production $q^*$ is defined as $y^*$ times area $k_a$. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- q^* = k_a y^* -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Substituting this into Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0} gives -->

<!-- \end{split} -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Axiom 3 states that farms enter production only if they expect to make non-negative profit. This condition may be formalized $R^* > C^*$, which in turn implies $P > C^{\#}$. By axiom 3, then, the upper bound of integration $\bar{C}^{\#}$ must be $P$. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- Q = N E[k_a] \frac{E[y^*]}{E[C^{\# \eta}]} \int_{0}^{P} C^{\# \eta} \rho(C^{\#}) dC^{\#} -->

<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Where $\Phi()$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, $m_{\#} = E[\ln(C^{\#})]$, and $s^2_{\#} = Var[\ln(C^{\#})]$. (See Appendix A2 for a proof of this step.) -->

<!-- Substituing the right hand side of this equation for the integral in the previous equation results in the following expression for aggregate supply. -->

<!-- Assuming that output price follows a gBm (axiom 5), the stochastic model for $C^{\#}(t)$ follows directly from the gBm model for $P(t)$. That is to say, since ${C}^{\#}(t)$ and $P(t)$ are related by Equation \ref{eq:useful}, then, by Ito's lemma, $C^{\#}(t)$ must also follow a gBm with trend and volatility parameters ($m_c$, $s_c$) equal to those of the output price ($m_p$, $s_p$). (See Appendix for details.) It then follows trivially that the mean and variance of the log change $\ln(C^{\#}(T)/C^{\#}(\hat{t}))$ are equal to those of the log change in output price displayed in Equations \ref{eq:lnChngP}. This means that -->
<!-- \begin{equation} -->

<!-- Those familiar with financial analysis will notice a similarity between the PEFS-adjusted mean probability of profit and the first $\Phi()$ term in the Black-Scholes equation, which indicates the probability that a stock price will finish at or above the strike price at maturity---in other words, that a European call option will finish "in the money" [@hull9thEdition]. Farm planting and expenditure decisions are thus mathematically analogous to investment banking decisions. In particular, the farm expected unit expenditure decision is analogous to selecting a strike price, while planting with harvest date $T$ is analogous to buying a derivative on the crop output price at that strike with maturity date $T$. The only major differences between farming and investment banking then seem to be that farmers generally have a much better track record, do much more work, are paid much less, and receive no government bailout in bad years. -->
<!-- Here it is tempting to introduce a sixth axiom saying that farmers will only pursue a risky bet if the probability of profit is greater than that of a coin toss (i.e., greater than $50\%$), and to thereby limit the domain of $z$ to $(-\infty, 0)$. But this is left to the discretion of the practitioner. [There are cases when rational economic agents pursue "out of the money" bets.] -->
<!-- The main purpose of developing the stochastic price parameter formulation of aggregate supply above is to demonstrate that the $\Phi()$ term in aggregate supply has a meaningful economic interpretation as the PEFS-adjusted mean probability of profit. -->
<!-- either the the farm population parameter formulation (Equation \ref{eq:aggSup2}) or the stochastic price parameter formulation (Equation \ref{eq:aggSup3}) can be used. -->
<!-- , taking care to estimate the unconditional population parameters $m_{\#}$ and $s_{\#}$ based on the observed conditional parameters as explained in section \ref{sec:aggSupDeterm}, -->

<!-- Parameterization of the expected aggregate supply curve requires knowledge of the expected harvest price at time of planting $E[P(T)]|_{t = 0}$, which can be calculated via Equation ... based on the price at planting $P(0)$ and length of cropping season $T$ if price series data is available by which to estimate $m_p$ and $s_p$. It also requires the number of farms in the population $N$, mean farm size $k_a$, the degree of homogeneity $h$. If calculating the PEFS-adj. mean probability of profit in the  in the farm population   the mean farm's expected unit cost as evaluated at planting time $E[\tilde{C}^{\#}(T)]|_{t = 0}$, and the expected mean harvested output as evaluated at planting time $E[\tilde{q}^*(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}$.  -->
<!-- <!-- As discussed in section ... Equation \ref{eq:cobbDoug4} has the advantage of requiring 
<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- E[y^*(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0} \approx \hat{y}^*|_{\mathbf{k}_{post} = \mathbf{\tilde{k}}_{post}}) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Now, as discussed in the previous section, the population mean of $E[y^*(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}$ may be considered equal to the expected value at planting time of the population mean harvested yield $\tilde{y}^*(T)$ (recall Equation \ref{eq:rubThm}). However, because of axiom 3, the sample mean of $E[y^*(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}$ does not represent the population mean, but rather the mean over a truncated population, i.e. $E[\tilde{y}^*(T) | C^# < E[P(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}]\bigr|_{t = 0}$. -->

<!-- In order to arrive at the population mean and redress count 2, the sample mean of $C^{\#}$ is first calculated as follows. -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- E[C^{\#}(T) | E[C^{\#}(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0} < E[P(T)]\bigr|_{t = 0}]\bigr|_{t = T} = E\left[ frac{C^*}{y^*(T)} \right] -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Given the assumption of lognormally distributed yield (axiom ...), then, by linear independence of the OLS regressors, $C^{\#}(T)$ is also lognormally distributed, such that the unobserved mean and variance of the untruncated distribution of $\ln(C^{\#}(T))$ ($m_c$, $s_c^2$) can be implicitly calculated from the observed (i.e. sample) mean and variance ($\overline{m}_c$, $\overline{s}_c^2$) by the following standard formulae. -->

<!-- Because the model is estimated in logs, the coefficients on the continuous variables may be interpreted as the control variable elasticities ($\kappa_i$). Note that the coefficient on acres is negative, affirming the inverse relation between farm size and yield found in numerous other studies [@muyanga2019revisiting; @larson2014should; @wassie2019revisiting; @gautam2019too; @kimhi2006plot]. The coefficient on child family labor during planting is also negative, confirming that this variable is better thought of as a hard constraint rather than a discretionary management variable. -->

<!-- This is where we talk about the continuous and binary variables used in the model and how other specifications are certainly feasible... lots of management variables available, but not required because of Equation \ref{eq:yStarC}. Models including farmer age, education, gender, maximum and minimum temperature, other types of family labor, and distance to market variables were also explored. But the coefficients on these variables were either statistically insignificant or introduced multicollinearity and/or missing data issues. A model based on Equation \ref{eq:cobbDoug3} was also estimated (provided in the Appendix) to compare h via mod2 against h as sum of estimated output elasticities of inputs. As discussed in sec..., the mod1 h varies across farms...the mod 2 h is very close to the mean h of mod1. -->

<!-- As discussed in section \ref{sec:ax12}, the independent continuous variables $k_i$ and $C^*$ are divided by their respective sample means $\tilde{k}_i$ and $\tilde{C}^*$ in order to facilitate interpretation of the constant $\tilde{y}$. (In the case of rainfall, $\tilde{k}_i$ is the historical average, not the sample average). The constant $\tilde{y}$ may then be interpreted as the farm yield evaluated at the sample mean of the continuous independent variables (at the historical mean in the case of rainfall). Insofar as the continuous independent variables are uncorrelated, moreover, then $E[\hat{y}^*] = \tilde{y} e^{s_{\epsilon}^2 / 2}$, where $s_{\epsilon}^2$ is the variance of the error $\epsilon$. -->
<!-- But $E[\hat{y}^*]$ is the sample mean.  -->

<!-- Conventional linear and constant elasticity of supply (CES) aggregate supply curves such as those featured in have long been used in ex-ante impact assessments of new agricultural technology [@alston1995science; @alston2009economics], are specified for the purpose of facilitating certain calculations (especially of economic surplus), with little or no consideration given to the plausibility of the theoretical underpinnings and empirical implications of the choice of functional form. In particular, it is unclear whether such models are consistent with standard microeconomic assumptions regarding homogeneity, convexity/concavity, profit maximization, and the slope of farm level supply and input demand curves. The documentation of such models might make passing reference to these axioms; but the models themselves are not formally derived from them. -->

<!-- Moreover, these conventional models do not explicitly account for the shape of the farm yield density (i.e., heterogeneity in farm endowments)---or, worse still, assume that all farms are homogeneously endowed and produce identically. This, in turn, precludes any explicit accounting for farm entry/exit effects on aggregate supply. In some sectors, one might reasonably justify this omission by invoking competitive long run equilibrium. The case for competitive long run equilibrium is strained in the primary sector, however, where one often sees an abundance of inframarginal farms in operation. Wohlgenant [-@wohlgenant1997nature] provides an analytical exploration of the distortions that can occur when neglecting to account for heterogeneity and inframarginal production. -->

<!-- As a direct consequence of the tenuous connection with reality and with standard theoretical premises described above, the mapping between the parameters that appear in these conventional models and the relevant, measurable empirical phenomena (i.e., technology, input prices, agroclimatic conditions, demographic variables, etc.) is likewise tenuous, such that it is not clear how a change in any of these phenomena might be accurately represented in terms of a change in parameter values, nor even which parameters are affected. This, in turn, precludes any endogenous modeling of economic decision making on the part of farmers in response to technology, or any other exogenous, shocks. Instead, such models introduce farm level economic decision making (i.e., the economically rational supply/expenditure/input mix response to the exogenous shock) as a calibrated assumption based on agronomic data gathered from field trials, literature, and/or consultation with scientists involved in the research under evaluation. -->

<!-- This bears emphasis.

<!-- then it is not readily apparent from conventional specifications of $Q$ what the functions $q^*$ and $\rho(q^*)$ are, nor whether they are consistent with microeconomic principles. Critically, expedient specifications of $Q$ also omit or gloss over farm entry and exit---i.e. the domain of profitable production $(\underline{q}^*, \overline{q}^*)$---such that it is not possible to decompose changes in aggregate supply into yield and farm entry/exit components. Some expedient forms also introduce awkward artifacts---such as the possibility of negative supply quantities and/or of farms producing for free, in the case of the linear aggregate supply curve---which further undermine the model's explanatory power. -->

<!-- The theoretical opacity of expedient aggregate models introduces considerable empirical opacity as well. That is to say, because expedient aggregate models are not explicitly built up from a farm level function of relevant, measurable, phenomena---i.e., technology, input prices, agroclimatic conditions, demographic variables, etc.---the mapping between these phenomena and the parameters appearing in the aggregate model is tenuous. This leaves very little basis upon which to assess the plausibility of different parameterizations of a given exogenous shock, or to attribute modeled impacts to the exogenous shock with confidence. -->


<!-- To redress the incredulity of policy makers insofar as it is directed at theoretically and empirically opaque modeling of aggregate supply and of research/policy induced supply curve shifts, here I derive an aggregate supply model prioritizing theoretical transparency and consistency. More specifically, I 1) derive a farm level production function $q^*$ from three non-controversial microeconomic axioms, 2) introduce a lognormal farm density function $\rho(q^*)$ as the fourth axiom, which then leads to a simplification of the integral in Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0} to a tractable analytic expression, and 3) introduce a fifth axiom to explicitly account for the stochastic character of output price and yield, which then leads to an even more instructive and intuitive form of the integral in Equation \ref{eq:aggSup0}. including a term that explicitly captures farm entry/exit in response to price movements and risk. This term is surprisingly instructive and intuitive, as it is proportionate to the probability that output price will be greater than the mean farm's expected unit cost at harvest---i.e. the mean farm's probability of profit. Because the model is explicitly built up from a farm level function, all parameters appearing in the model have a straightforward mapping to the relevant, measurable, empirical phenomena, such that the supply and expenditure response to changes in these phenomena is modeled endogenously, as opposed to being exogenously asserted as in the expedient conventional way.   The supply response---aggregate or farm level---to changes in any of these phenomena, whether it be technology, input prices, agroclimatic variables, or something else, is easily inspected by differentiating the aggregate supply curve with respect to the variable of concern. This allows for high fidelity, explicit modeling of simultaneous, multi-faceted exogenous shocks (e.g., a technology shock in conjunction with an input subsidy, considered under different future demographic and agroclimatic scenarios). The expedient model by contrast would have to introduce these shocks as exogenous changes in yield/expenditure, each of which with its own empirical justification conflict of interest issues, greatly compounding the problem.  It also allows for close inspection of conventional wisdom. The price elasticity of supply agrees with conventional wisdom, consisting of a technology term plus a farm entry/exit term. The derivative of aggregate supply with respect to technology, on the other hand, turns out to be considerably more complex than is typically assumed. Any results that seem peculiar can be traced back to specific assumptions regarding economic behavior, and/or the estimation of specific parameter values. ....the other desirable properties following as corollaries -->

<!-- The aggregate supply curve presented below is derived from the following five axioms: -->

<!-- The exogenously introduced yield and/or expenditure shock is typically estimated based on field trial data and/or consultation with scientists closely involved in the research. Model guidelines might mention the need to adjust the elicited estimate for differences between agronomically optimal yields at an experimental station and economically optimal yields in a real farm population; and to compensate for bias resulting from the glaring conflict of interest inherent in the expert opinion of scientists closely involved in the research under evaluation; but offer nothing in the way of practical, concrete steps that can be implemented within the timeframe of an impact assessment.     formal adjustment method since, in the name of expedience, no farm yield envelope is ever invoked or derived from microeconomic principles. -->

<!-- and b) recommend steps  But, as to (a),  The same guidelines might also  Alston et al. [], e.g., recommend creating an atmosphere (b) creating an environment of peer review and, perhaps, a competitive process (e.g., Delphi methods) that will reduce the potential for personal incentives to bias estimates of technical parameters, and (c) creating an institutional setting in which scientists will be held accountable for systematic biases in their estimates of research impact (e.g., by comparing actual achievements within programs over time against scientists' forecasts of what would be achieved). -->

<!-- Lindner and Jarrett note that inframarginal farms convergent divergent... Rose... Wohlgenant inframarginal. Alston et al. subsequently acknowledge that proportional shift is more realistic, and parallel quite unrealistic. (and lets not forget they are assuming identical marginal firms) -->
<!-- Rose's comment about the "only realistic strategy" is in reference to the impossibility of determining where the inframarginal farms are on the aggregate supply curve, and thus the impossibility of specifying the convergent/divergent shift. -->

<!-- In the assessment of technology shocks, particularly, it is unclear how the shock might be accurately represented in terms of a change in the model's parameters, or even which parameters are affected. Instead of attempting to represent the technological shock directly, then, expedient models typically forgo any endogenous economic modeling of the relation between technology and management, and instead introduce the farm supply and/or expenditure response to technology exogenously, based on field trial data and consultation with scientists involved in the research under evaluation.  -->

<!-- The subsequent step of determining how the exogenously introduced farm level supply/expenditure shock then manifests at the aggregate level is likewise less a matter of endogenous economic modeling than it is of exogenous guesswork translated into mathematical symbols. The usual assumption since the 1990s is that the shock manifests as a parallel shift of the aggregate supply curve [@alston1995science]. But no theoretical or empirical grounds exist for this preference over, say, a supply curve pivot, or a combination of pivot and shift, which would result in a very different calculation of net benefits [@alston1995science; @alston2009economics]. [Again, because there is no clear mapping between model parameters and empirical phenomena, then, by construction, the model can offer no .] -->

But first, it is worthwhile to pause and take stock of some important implications of the derivation thus far that diverge from or even contradict the conventional wisdom permeating much of the agricultural economic surplus literature. To begin with, 

This is a particularly instructive expression because it indicates precisely under what circumstances optimal unit expenditure changes. Specifically, the expression indicates that optimal unit expenditure increases with improvements in technology (increases in $h$) and output price, and decreases with the budget shadow price. Note, moreover, that Equation \ref{eq:YdEnvNeatSharp} indicates that yield is positively correlated with optimal unit cost. The presumption at agricultural research institutions (and one that permeates much of the agricultural economic surplus analysis literature), on the other hand, is that an improvement in technology _exogenously_ lowers expenditure and/or increases yield. Insofar as axioms 1 and 2 are true, Equations \ref{eq:YdEnvNeatSharp} and \ref{eq:useful} demonstrate that this presumption is fallacious. It is a presumption that may be true under other axioms---e.g., by replacing axiom 2 (profit maximization) with a production quota axiom---but cannot be true under the axioms adopted here.

Specification of the aggregate supply curve may be considered a case in point.

Many of these surmises imply well documented contradictions of basic economic theory, and/or inconvenient ramifications vis-a-vis the supposed benefits of research and technology adoption [].

In defense of CobbDoug
[Mention the good empirical fit and validation tests (input demand, optimal area, etc.) as arguments in favor of C-D]

Translog is so "flexible" that it ends up being restrictive from an economic standpoint---not homogeneous, monotonicity and concavity, global concavity requires negative semidefinite matrix of parameters, enforcement of which "destroys the flexibility of the form" and restricts the price elasticities in undesired way (from "Estimating a Derived Demand System from a Translog Cost Function"). Jorgenson etc. have to then devise ways to make it less flexible, in order to impose constant returns to scale, for eg.  Translog also violates axiom 1

However, it does not directly address---not in an obvious way---the most enduring objections to the form: its perceived conflict with evidence and intuitions regarding 1) input substitution, 2) production elasticities, and 3) factor demand elasticities. A complete response to these objections is beyond the scope of the work at hand. Nonetheless, a minimal response is sketched out below in the hopes of retaining the attention of the many vigorous critics of Cobb-Douglas who might otherwise read no further.

Enduring objection 1 is that the Cobb-Douglas function implies a unitary elasticity of input substitution, whereas intuition and evidence clearly suggest otherwise. Arrow et al. [-@arrow1961capital] set the tone in their seminal article:

>"Technological alternatives are numerous and flexible in some sectors, limited in others; and uniform substitutability is most unlikely. The difference in elasticities is confirmed by direct observation of capital-labor proportions, which show much more variation among countries in some sectors than in others".

However, the authors here are objecting not to unitary elasticity of substitution, but rather "uniform substitutability". The measure of substitutability of one input for another in a two factor model $y(x_1, x_2)$ given an output target is not the elasticity of substitution, but rather the marginal rate of substitution, $dx_1/dx_2$. And the phrase "uniform substitutability" followed closely by the word "elasticities" may reasonably be interpreted as $d\ln(x_1)/\ln(dx_2) = 1$. (Hundreds of subsequent authors espousing this objection appear to mean this, at any rate.) It is straightforward to show that the two factor Cobb-Douglas model does not imply this. On the contrary, it implies

\begin{equation}
\frac{d \ln(x_1)}{d\ln(x_2)} = -\frac{\alpha_2}{\alpha_1}
\end{equation}

And thus agrees with Arrow et al.'s observations regarding the unlikelihood of "uniform substitutability".

At the same time, it is true that the two factor Cobb-Douglas model implies a unitary elasticity of substitution. But the elasticity of substitution is not a measure of factor substitutability. It is a measure of how factor proportions change with substitutability. A unitary elasticity of substitution thus means that a $1\%$ change in substitutability ($dx_1/dx_2$) results in a $1\%$ change in the input usage ratio $x_1/x_2$. In plain English: a change in substitutability of $x_1$ for $x_2$ results in a proportionate change in the substitution of $x_1$ for $x_2$. One may conjecture without controversy that most farm managers would consider this an eminently reasonable characterization of management decision-making.

Enduring objection 2 is that the Cobb-Douglas production elasticities $\alpha_i$ are constant, whereas intuition suggests that production elasticities are functions of inputs, and should thus vary with input use. To lift this "restriction", the translog production function was introduced, with production elasticities defined as Cobb-Douglas functions of the inputs.

While the Cobb-Douglas production elasticities are indeed constant, it is fallacious to then conclude from this that they are not functions of the inputs. On the contrary, by Euler's theorem it is straightforward to show that

\begin{equation}
\alpha_i = \left(\frac{h - 1}{h} \right)  \frac{x_i}{y} \sum_{j}^{n} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} x_j
\end{equation}

And, moreover,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} = \frac{1}{h - 2}  \sum_{k}^{n} \frac{\partial}{ \partial x_i} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x_j \partial x_k} x_k
\end{equation}

And, so on for any order $\mathcal{\ell}$ of differentiation, ad infinitum,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^{\ell} y}{\partial x_i^{\ell}} = \frac{1}{h - \ell + 1}  \sum_{j}^{n} \frac{\partial^{\ell + 1} y}{\partial x_i^{\ell + 1} \partial x_j} x_j
\end{equation}

That is to say, for $h \neq 1$, the Cobb-Douglas production elasticities are not just functions of all inputs, but also of the $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$, $\dots$,$\infty^{th}$ order variation of production with respect to inputs, as well as the interactions of these implied in the successive orders of cross derivatives. That all this complex interaction should add up to a constant is a sign not of oversimplification, then, but of mathematical serendipity stemming from axiom 1. The translog function, meanwhile, is not derived from any first principle and is not even a homogeneous function. Which, then, is the more restrictive model? translog also violates axiom 1.

It may be added that the economic principle of net-benefit maximization (cost minimization) implies that optimal input quantities are functions of prices and control variables, and are thus constant. In this sense, the translog production elasticities are also constant.

The same riposte applies to enduring objection 3, namely, that the Cobb-Douglas input demand elasticities are constant, whereas intuition and evidence indicate that input demand elasticities vary with input use. Again, it is true that Cobb-Douglas demand elasticities are constant. But, again, this does not mean that they are not functions of inputs. On the assumption that producers maximize their net benefit (or minimize cost), the Cobb-Douglas input demand own and cross price elasticities follows as

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

The input own and cross price demand elasticities are thus functions of price and technology. Because optimal input use is also a function of price, these elasticities may be written as functions of input use, if so desired. Conversely, the Hicks-Allen partial elasticities derived using the translog model may be written in terms of prices, if so desired.
